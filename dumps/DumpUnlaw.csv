"The method shows clearly that what we believe determines how much we
can do. As Wim points out, “Whether you think you can or you think you can’t,
you are right.” ",0
The true story is that Wim has shown us what we all can do.,0
"We already know some specific things about the method, such as how the breathing method can temporarily change the pH of our blood.",0
"The truly remarkable story here is Wim’s own, as revealed in these pages.",0
I have been following the emerging peer-reviewed research on the Wim Hof Method closely.,0
The trial is expected to be completed this year.,0
"The true story is of one man’s passion, his love for nature, for all living beings, for his family, for humanity, and thus his drive to share what he now knows to hopefully heal sickness.",0
"As someone who loves meditation, I believe it is an especially interesting state from which to observe the mind.",0
The method shows clearly that what we believe determines how much we can do.,0
"The method requires engagement of body and mind, and at least some belief.",0
. Allow yourself to experience the Wim Hof Method in your own body and make your own discoveries.,0
But what if we could reawaken the dormant physiological processes that made our ancestors so strong?,0
"I have employed this method to accomplish feats believed by many to be impossible, setting more than two dozen Guinness World Records and confounding medical professionals in the process.",0
"Doing these things has earned me the nickname the Iceman, but I am no superhero.",0
This method is accessible to all.,0
The secret to a lifetime of health and happiness is within your grasp,0
"I will explain the ins and outs of my method, the philosophy that underpins it, and the science that supports it.",0
"It’s all there for you, and there’s no time to waste.",0
It’s where you and I and everyone else began. It’s where all life begins.,0
She felt a strangeness inside of her.,0
"And as she had already delivered four children previously, she knew she was not mistaken.",0
"The doctor went away, and my mother was again left alone in the room to recover.",0
"Yet in those days, women could not work anymore after having children.",0
"Their father raised the kids all by himself, which at that time was quite rare.",0
But then I began to breathe.,0
", I’ve always had a yearning for something else, for something more, something deeper, mystical — something strange.",0
", I’ve always had a yearning for something else, for something more, something deeper, mystical — something strange.",0
And this rosy feeling came over me and made me just sit down in the snow.,0
But I had been out there so long that they became worried.,0
"So they picked me up out of the snow and took me home, and it was actually quite terrible getting back because I was hypothermic.",0
"I went to school, and on my way home, I decided that I wanted to sit down.",0
"I woke up in the hospital, and they kept me there for observation for a week.",0
"And despite the very real danger they both posed, they were actually quite nice.",0
"The fellow who had poured the bottle over me harbored no malicious intent, I don’t believe.",0
"He was just being mischievous, but at the same time imposing his will over me by saying, in effect, “I’m eight years old and much bigger than you, and look what I can do to you.",0
"And when I did, I spent the next two nights vomiting green before my parents finally took me to the hospital.",0
"In that, I suppose these episodes were harbingers of what was to come.",0
"We’d tie them to each other, hang them over the branches, and then swing from one tree to another making Tarzan’s jungle call as loudly as we could because we were the apes.",0
To this day I believe those potatoes were the best food I’ve ever eaten.,0
I think nowadays many children miss out on that.,0
"This, of course, was because of my mother, who was a devout Catholic.",0
And there was no escaping from a mother like that.,0
"On Saturdays I could go into the woods, get myself dirty, do my Tarzan shout at the top of my lungs.",0
A forest is like a wonderland for a child with a creative imagination.,0
Live animals were being delivered by trucks and being killed.,0
"The more I thought about it, the more determined I became to decrease the amount of meat I consumed each day.",0
"When it came to history, language, mathematics, science, and all, my grades were just average.",0
"My instincts and intuition were leading me in a different direction, and that’s because of my mother.",0
"I delivered newspapers, both Algemeen Dagblad and De Telegraaf, in the early morning hours.",0
"I delivered newspapers, both Algemeen Dagblad and De Telegraaf, in the early morning hours.",0
"I don’t know what it was about those old bikes, really, but they got to me.",0
"All those mornings delivering newspapers on those hills no matter the weather made me stronger, and not just physically.",0
"Every day for five years, I woke up at 3:30 a.m.",0
"Then I’d go out into the night with these packs full of newspapers, up and down the hills of Sittard.",0
It was just me and my bicycle and the newspapers alone in the hills.,0
You begin to contemplate; you see the world in peace without the rumor of anything or anybody.,0
You begin to contemplate; you see the world in peace without the rumor of anything or anybody.,0
I remember snow and very cold temperatures.,0
". We have mostly lost this connection today, this deep sense, and thus, many of us aren’t able to incorporate its values into our everyday life.",0
"More than forty years later, I can still taste those fruits, smell the sweetness of that air.",0
"You radiate an electromagnetic field, and that’s the corona.",0
So comport yourself as a king or a queen and stand proudly in your corona because that’s who you are inside.,0
"I didn’t know it, but I was looking for exactly that back then.",0
My mother’s invocation really was the redline of my history.,0
"There was much unseen, and I yearned desperately to see it.",0
Meeting people who were more exuberant and open liberated my mind.,0
"It’s amazing what can happen within your core if you get there, if you meet the light within yourself. You just know it.",0
"Near the border of France and Spain, in the Pyrenees, Andre and I met a man named Wolfgang.",0
"The lion saw him and probably also the reflection of the sun on his bike or something, and it ran away.",0
The other thing I remember about Wolfgang is that he listened intently to everything I had to say.,0
He could sense that I was searching for something within the depth of myself without fully knowing what it was and that he could learn from me.,0
"There was no fear. He just knew. And I didn’t, at least not yet. I was just there.",0
This was a monumental epiphany for me.,0
"Too often we mistake this knowledge for dreams or, worse, folly.",0
"Andre would listen in sometimes, but most of the time, he stayed about a quarter mile in front of us.",0
"I realized that we all have this sacred spot within us, and it became my aim to access it.",0
"And for the three weeks that followed, I remained in that transcendent state of being.",0
That time represented a period of true freedom for me because there were absolutely no rules.,0
About a hundred people lived together in peaceful coexistence and creative abundance.,0
"So we had a lot of art over there, a lot of music.",0
"You retreat from society because you want to free your own mind, but first you have to learn to let it go.",0
"I felt an attraction to it that I couldn’t quite explain, but I looked around, and there was nobody else in sight.",0
That curiosity was much stronger than the temperature of the water.,0
"You could die, they said. It’s no good! It’s an adverse element of nature, and we have to protect ourselves from it!",0
Now we can understand that the strength of my curiosity being greater than the cold of the water was a demonstration of the human mind’s immense power.,0
"Thus, our minds are not able to transcend the impact of extreme forces on our bodies or to accept the truth of mind over matter.",0
But it all began in earnest right there. It was the origin point of my entire quest.,0
"Of course, whenever you feel as good about something as I did about this, you’re bound to come back often.",0
"I was only seventeen, and I felt alive and excited.",0
I felt great because I knew that I was on to something. And I was. The Iceman had been born.,0
"We are beings of light who, by birthright, own our own minds and souls.",0
That consciousness allows you to truly trust your judgment based on intuition and instinct.,0
"My American friend Chris Ryan wrote a book entitled Civilized to Death on these deeper feelings, about how we have become so civilized, so ensconced in our comfort zones, that it has gotten the better of us.",0
"Regardless of if it is warm or hot, our core body temperature has to remain 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. If your core temperature dips only 2 or 3 degrees below that, you go into hypothermia, a hypothermic state.",0
But what did we do? We got into clothes.,0
These little muscles do not work. And do you know who’s paying for that?,0
"That’s one of the primary reasons, together with diet and exercise, why cardiovascular-related diseases are the number-one killer in our society.",0
"Then, once it’s awakened and optimized, let’s say in ten days, a whole sequence of magic begins to occur within the body.",0
It is therefore understandable why some might be reluctant to willingly submit to that discomfort. It’s unpleasant.,0
"I began intuitively, when I was seventeen years old, to venture into the cold water.",0
I have dedicated my life to this because I have experienced the benefits firsthand.,0
"I just simplified it. We are able, as a society, to confront cardiovascular-related diseases if we can learn, collectively, how to achieve vascular fitness.",0
That translates to a lot less stress. It’s important to understand that your heart rate increases whenever your body experiences stress.,0
"Your heart needs to pump more, work harder.",0
"It all adds up, and the result is that your heart has to pump even more without any way to cool down, to have a rest, because your vascular system is compromised.",0
"You can go and do exercises outdoors in the cold while bare-chested and barefoot, just in shorts.",0
Cold showers are the gateway to flow and energy and peace.,0
"As your vascular system awakens and its muscles begin to tone up, it forges a connection with your brain, with your will.",0
"When prehistoric humans ventured forth out of their caves and into the wild, they had to be strong.",0
"So a prehistoric man knew, when he went out to hunt, that his body would respond accordingly.",0
"The rest of the body can get quite cold, but if the vascular tone is not right, the body doesn’t respond.",0
"If we take cold showers though, we can regain the lost, optimized condition of our vascular tone and in turn become strong.",0
And it’s amazing what kinds of health benefits stem from there.,0
With that comes peace. Deep peace.,0
"Yes, it’s going to give you a lot more energy. Yes, your heart rate will go down.",0
The cold is merciless but righteous. It will show you the way.,0
"The deeper parts of your physiology suddenly open up, which they have to do because the water really is freezing, and it impacts your body powerfully.",0
You can learn to control it by going gradually into the cold and following your feelings.,0
"You have to take a shower anyway, right? So, it’s very simple. Just end up cold.",0
"Because the cold is merciless but righteous, we can learn from it.",0
"Do you want to learn to deal with stress, or do you want to continue suffering? This method is very simple, very accessible, and endorsed by science.",0
"Those parts of modern man’s brain receive less blood flow than those of our prehistoric ancestors, and while those deeper parts survive, they don’t flourish.",0
"A cold shower a day, that’s the one. That’s the ticket to this ride.",0
The idea was to monitor brain activity and measure differences in the subjects’ skin temperature relative to each exposure.,0
That is the paradigm. I call it “the disconnection” because we do not know the power of our minds.,0
"By employing a deep breathing technique that effectively activated my intercostal muscles (those located between the ribs), I was able to generate enough heat on the first day to maintain my core body temperature.",0
I was instructed to participate passively.,0
"So that morning, I was sitting in my hotel room, looking out my window over Detroit, and thinking, How do I show it?",0
What did you do in the icy waters beyond the Polar Circle? What did you do always in the cold? You trusted yourself.,0
"Mind and body are in sync. After all these years, this was quite an epiphany.",0
Let whatever images and thoughts pass freely and then fall away whilst you are reaching your depth.,0
The method is based on the principle that the power of the mind works in connection with the body to impact human capability in a profound way.,0
"This helps train the muscle of belief, belief in what we are capable of, which allows us to have confidence in our hearts.",0
They had never seen anything like it before.,0
My temperature never changed. That’s the power of the mind when it has been awakened by the cold and the breath.,0
"This offers a new perspective on how we might be able to deal with psychosis, fear, anxiety, depression, or bipolar disorder independent of drugs.",0
". In the February 2018 issue of NeuroImage, professors Muzik and Diwadkar wrote, “We found compelling evidence of the key components of the autonomous processes of the brain related to mood regulation.”",0
"It is important to recognize the gravity of this discovery. It’s reminiscent of the fable about the wise men coming together and asking, “What do we do about the soul, since people have made such a mess out of it?”",0
"And then one stands up and says, “I’ve got it! Put it in the people themselves since they never look there.”",0
"Those processes are within our will, and with that, our perspective on the human capacity to deal with mood regulation, depression, trauma, and fear must change in accordance.",0
"Without the breath, we are nothing, but by controlling it, we are able to access the neurology of our consciousness, our perception.",0
"The will is a neurological muscle, but if the biochemistry isn’t right, it’s not able to do very much.",0
"Our society today has us living in a narrowed narrative, and therein we get conditioned.",0
It’s mind over matter. What we always thought of as abstract or beyond our reach is attainable. But you don’t actually have to think about it.,0
My brain scans demonstrated that it is possible to enter into the deepest part of the brain.,0
"I felt no cold at all. I felt no stress. Instead
I felt warm. I felt great.",0
The Wayne State study is the first step in validating this method as a natural remedy for people with health conditions.,0
I found those answers in nature. This is an innate power we all possess.,0
"The trees exhale oxygen, and we exhale CO2 . We nourish each other. We are one.",0
"I was highly motivated to make a change, to offer an alternative solution for those afflicted with mental illness. Now, a quarter century later, we are getting to some answers.",0
". It is very simple, and now, through science — with data — we have proven that we possess the innate capacity to control our mind.",0
"It’s all there for you, and we have proven through science that it works. It just needs awakening. A cold shower a day keeps the doctor away.",0
"And with that spiking of alkalinity, the brain’s adrenal axis is activated.",0
"Now, by employing these simple breathing techniques, we are able to suppress the inflammatory markers in the blood.",0
"As you’ll see in the chapters to come, we changed the books.",0
"I am convinced that by changing our biochemistry from acidic to alkaline and cleansing ourselves of biochemical residue, we can eliminate the primary causes of diseases",0
"When you breathe in deeply, your diaphragm moves, and that massages your intestines.",0
"The breathing protocol, which is composed of three to four rounds, takes about twenty minutes to complete.",0
Only it’s not really the belly; it’s the lungs being filled to their utmost capacity. The belly goes up because it needs to make space.,0
Eating beforehand can inhibit this physiological reaction.,0
"Let it in fully, then let it go. It is the sea itself.",0
"It’s about filling the belly and letting it go, like a wave. A wave comes up on the beach, on the shore, and then it recedes.",0
Do this thirty times or until you feel lightheaded with a tingling sensation in your arms and hands and a looseness in your body.,0
"Fully in, letting go, fully in, letting go. Find your rhythm and follow it.",0
"Now we are going to bring the consciousness in. Yes, the breath is a door. It leads to corridors that take us deep within ourselves",0
"After you let the fortieth breath go, stop after the exhalation.",0
"You’re the alchemist now. You’re the one who’s doing it, and you’re in control.",0
"Now we are going to bring the consciousness in. Yes, the breath is a door. It leads to corridors that take us deep within ourselves.",0
"You can keep count on your fingers or in your mind. By now you should definitely be feeling the lightheadedness, tingling, and looseness I described. Intensify those sensations by breathing into them.",0
Holding your breath here will be fairly easy because your newfound alkalinity lessens the body’s need for oxygen.,0
"That’s the way man existed in nature originally — alert, fully present, and just being.",0
"Advancing in the technique, you may encounter lights, visions. It’s up to you how far you want to go with this because the feeling can be rather intense.",0
"When you feel a real urge to breathe again, go ahead. Breathe in once, inhaling fully, and then, when your lungs are full, stop again.",0
"And as the body’s electricity activates the hormones in the pineal gland, images and experiences locked deep within your subconscious mind enter your consciousness.",0
"The experience can trigger lights or familiar faces, shapes and images to enter into your consciousness.",0
"That may sound far-out to you, but it’s true. We are the alchemists, and we are built to be in command of our own soul, light, spirit, and life.",0
"When the breath gets into the brain’s electricity, it affects our neurological activity in a profound way",0
This is only the beginning of your journey to unlock the unlimited power of your mind.,0
"You have to train in this. Be still, and breathe. That is where the depth is gained.",0
"This increased alkalinity also increases the amount of time it takes for your body to build up an acidic state again, which is what triggers the urge to breathe.",0
"So, during round number two, you will notice you can go a little longer without air in the lungs.",0
"That’s the trinity of our spirit, of our soul’s purest expression. The Vedas were written thousands of years ago, but their truth endures.",0
"Don’t worry too much about how long you can hold your breath. If you are dealing with a lot of inflammation, you may need to breathe sooner. In this way, the breath is like a mirror that shows you the state you are in.",0
Every round sends more blood and electricity into the brain.,0
"These factors have many benefits, not only for your physical health but also spiritually.",0
All after just four rounds of breathing. WHM PROTOCOL: BASIC BREATHING E,0
"But that’s not all this breathing method can do. In January 2014, I led a group of twenty-six people trained in the method up Tanzania’s Mount Kilimanjaro with a goal of reaching the summit in three days.",0
"All the physiologists, doctors, and alpine experts I consulted said that what I was trying to do was irresponsible.",0
"And when we came back down the mountain, the critics were silent.",0
"A year later we returned to Kilimanjaro and reached the summit in just thirty-six hours. And the year after that, we did it in just over twenty-eight hours. Unbelievable.",0
"… In comparison with previous studies, this report may suggest that acclimatization, as well as AMS symptom relief, can be safely accelerated.”",0
"Among the many health-beneficial applications of the breathing method is its ability to regulate that which causes disease, namely inflammation.",0
And they come because our biochemical nature is out of balance.,0
"So on top of its manifold benefits, this breathing method may also help you ward off illness.",0
We have to quit with this comfort-zone behaviorism and get back to our innermost needs. How do you do that? By breathing.,0
"Not your mind, the breath. Follow your breath, and it will lead you anywhere in your brain — thus the mind — that you want to go.",0
"The science is clear. It works. People come up to me with questions like, “Should I breathe through the nose?” or “The diaphragm this or that,” and I just say, “Yeah, breathe, motherfuckers! Don’t think, just do it!",0
"All of that stress just takes us further away from nature, but the breath will take you back. It will forge that deeper connection we have lost.",0
So we can become lawyers and businesspeople? So we can make lots of money to buy a big house or a fancy car but that can’t buy us happiness or health?,0
I developed these exercises after going into the cold because the first thing you do when you encounter the cold is gasp.,0
"You bring the air deeper into your lungs, and with that air entering deeper into your tissues, your body’s chemistry begins to change.",0
"That’s why we do the breathing first, before going into the cold.",0
"This is conscious breathing, which is different from the three or four rounds with retention that we do while lying or sitting down in a safe place.",0
"Just clear your mind, be determined, and trust your breath because the breath goes everywhere — inside and out.",0
"The energy of the cold’s impact met the energy generated by my deep breathing, and the effect was transformative. It wasn’t long before I could stay in icy water for hours.",0
I could stay outside in the cold all night long because I learned how to regulate my energy through my breath and my consciousness. You can do it too.,0
"You get ten times more energy back as the blood flow begins to run through your body, and it makes your mind still.",0
Afterward you will see that your skin is all red and beautifully colored because the skin is alive.,0
"The best thing you can do for your skin is to go into cold water — not shockingly, but gradually; I’m sixty-one years old, and I still have skin like a baby’s.",0
"The cold exists beyond our thoughts, and if we go into it gradually — by increasing incrementally, say, the length of our cold shower each day — we find that within ten days, a cascade of things begins to happen.",0
You feel more alive.,0
The breathing also regulates the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.,0
This is integral for overall health and well-being. This is alchemy. This book is about showing you how to tap into your long-do,0
"For now, just continue on with the cold showers and practicing the breathing techniques, as they work wonders.",0
"It’s time to embrace our inner mammals before it’s too late, before we lose our connection to our inner nature forever.",0
"Through the cold, we are able to activate the blood flow and get it within our willful control. We gain this control from the mind.",0
"It includes the idea of will and the power to imagine, to meditate, to visualize — the power to send your attention to any part of your body, to observe any bodily process.",0
Scientific studies and personal experience give us the confidence we need to do the method. They gave me the confidence to continue on my mission.,0
"Then, suddenly, the body’s autonomic processes take over. We have to go deeper to cut through our conditioning and gain control of those processes.",0
The cold is a teacher. It’s merciless. You don’t picnic when you go into the cold. You don’t think about your mortgage or your kid’s braces or your divorce; you just survive.,0
"Suddenly your consciousness syncs with your biochemistry, and you can naturally address what ails you — anxiety, fear, depression, what have you.",0
"That’s what the cold water does. It teaches you not only how to survive, but to thrive. It’s all within your control.",0
"The body should be in balance, but it isn’t. Because of our current lifestyles, we live with permanent low levels of infection.",0
The experimental group has shown us that it is possible to repress that inflammatory response. I hope that this leads to much more research.”,0
"Devoted practitioners of the method have been able to reverse diabetes, alleviate the debilitating effects of Parkinson’s disease, lose weight, and achieve remarkable athletic feats.",0
Tune out distractions. Turn off your television and leave your phone in another room when you begin the breathing exercises each morning.,0
These twenty to twenty-five minutes a day require your complete attention.,0
This confidence is nothing abstract. I am not talking about believing in something blindly.,0
"You are in charge. Develop confidence and conviction in what you are doing. It is only then that you will be able to connect to your inner power, to your true nature.",0
A 2015 proof-of-principle study added on to the Endotoxin experiment showed that a higher level of optimism related to an even stronger immune response.,0
"Whatever it is, I simply want to bring people back to their inner power.",0
Do the breathing. See how it feels. Go into the cold.,0
"Your mindset, your attitude plays a critical role in determining your success or failure in any endeavor, and these techniques are no exception.",0
And love is like its own life-force; it makes you fly.,0
"Love for life, love between one another, love for anything that happens — good or bad — because we are precious, amazing beings of infinite potential. Believe it.",0
"Life is within me, and I know its purpose, which is to radiate love. If that makes me crazy, so be it.",0
What else would make you happy? To own six cars? A big house? Material things are external and have no bearing on the soul.,0
"The conductor is love, which is the greatest power in the universe because it enables the soul to express itself.",0
"That connection is called love, and with this method, we are able to spread it around and heal this world. It’s time.",0
"So you can decide for yourself whether or not you want to be happy, strong, and healthy.",0
"But for now, it is enough just to feel and see and believe. What do you want?",0
"They understood it to be based loosely on the ancient Tibetan practice of tummo, or inner heat.",0
"To prove they have mastered it, they have to dry out a wet sheet with only their body heat while sitting in meditation in the freezing cold Himalayan air.",0
"Twenty-five years of trial and error, of testing, tweaking, and refining my practice had led me to this point.",0
"People gathered around, including media from all over the world, all surveilling me with their electronic eyes as I climbed inside the plexiglass.",0
"Just a few months earlier, I had run a full marathon on Mount Everest, at an altitude of about fifteen thousand feet, barefoot for eight hours.",0
"I brought the kata to New York with me and, considering the Rubin Museum’s specialized focus and hoping it still possessed some magic, wore it around my head.",0
I knew what I was doing and what was going to happen because I had programmed it.,0
I could increase the amount of metabolic activity going on and also activate all kinds of hormones to generate heat from within.,0
"My experience on Everest proved instructive, as I ran the marathon there confronted not only by snow and freezing temperatures, but also on approximately half the oxygen that is available at sea level.",0
"That’s what I did on Everest, and I employed the same technique that day outside the museum in New York.",0
"And being in alignment with the moment, with what was happening, helped activate my body.",0
"Cold and heat work like emotions too. Emotion in the end is biological, a biological stress within, expressed through hormones.",0
"I didn’t know it at the time, but that’s what I was doing outside the museum.",0
"Now I know why I had such control. Dr. Kamler, who was monitoring me the entire time, had never seen anything like it before, and he’s the authority on surviving in extreme conditions.",0
Wim has proven this wrong. His body temperature dropped to 88 degrees and then came back up to 94 without any external heat source.,0
"Three hundred people were in attendance, and I got up on stage and told my story to an American audience, in English, for the first time.",0
"But as I spoke, I could see skepticism creeping across faces throughout the audience.",0
"I will try!” I put my hand up in the air, and on the screen, the imaging showed blue, which indicated a normal temperature.",0
"Within a minute, I was able to raise the temperature by 12 degrees.",0
"I say fewer because there were then, as there are now and as there have always been, people who simply refuse to believe what they see.",0
"But all I am doing is harnessing the tremendous power of the mind, which, again, is an innate capacity we all have within us.",0
"That was a great evening, and I met some wonderful people. It was a very emotional experience for me because it was clear that I had touched people.",0
"It uplifted my soul. I went to bed that night feeling as if I had really turned a corner, and I had. But my adventure in America was only beginning.",0
Professor Bushell had spent nearly twenty years in the department of anthropology at MIT and also had academic affiliations with Harvard and Columbia Universities.,0
"Professor Bushell is a kind man, extremely knowledgeable, and his support and friendship have helped boost our credibility in the scientific community immeasurably.",0
"How that could be done, however, was unknown. And that is why they brought me out to Manhasset.",0
Then they inserted a needle in one of my arms to withdraw blood and connected my other arm to a heart-and-lung monitor.,0
They told me it would take a week for the results because they’d be analyzing 307 different blood markers to see if I was influencing my vagus nerve.,0
"The physiologists were both amazed that I was able to maintain my core temperature, as neither had ever seen anything like it before despite studying the cold for years.",0
"After that, we returned to New York, and soon after, I received a telephone call from Dr. Kamler.",0
"The experiment showed that I was controlling an autonomous mechanism at will, which meant in turn that I was able to control inflammation, the cause and effect of so many diseases.",0
"A half hour later, I received a telephone call from my wife. My mother had died. She had fallen, gone into a coma, and died.",0
You did so good. I will serve my mission and honor you by spreading my message to as many people as I can.,0
"In the weeks that followed, Dr. Kamler, Dr. Tracey, and I made plans by telephone to conduct a comparative study at a Buddhist retreat in the Catskills of New York.",0
"When I arrived at the theater, there were at least twenty people and even more monitors.",0
They took thirty-six vials of blood over the eighty minutes and sent them to six different laboratories for analysis.,0
"During the entire eighty minutes in which I was exposed to the ice, my core body temperature remained at a constant 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit.",0
"“This individual may have influenced the autonomic nervous system, thereby actively regulating the cardiovascular system and thermoregulation.”",0
I was able to function and to talk to everybody who came up to me and to answer their endless questions.,0
"The doctors had taken a lot of my blood during the experiment, so they decided to conduct some experiments on it in addition to their analysis.",0
"But because my blood had not reacted to the bacteria outside of my body, they were curious to see if my body could suppress the inflammatory markers commonly caused by the injection.",0
"We announced the blood results on television, and I cried because I was so happy.",0
The only problem was that scientific evidence is only valid if it’s done with a comparative group.,0
"We had done it! Finally, we had the proof we had been seeking. We were no longer a test panel of one.",0
"They weren’t special or remarkable really, in any way, but they each gave me 100 percent of their focus.",0
They would have to hand themselves over to it just as they would have to do in the experiment.,0
"When we came to the ridge and looked over to the other side, we saw Czech military personnel all dressed up like ninjas.",0
That made the guys feel like badasses for sure.,0
They were awakened and connected inside to a greater energy than they had previously known.,0
But scientists can be a stubborn lot sometimes. They can move as slow as a turtle.,0
"I was disappointed of course, but I’m not waiting for a Nobel Prize. I don’t need that kind of external validation",0
"Back yourself. Care for yourself. Not by protecting your ego, no, but by remaining present for your being when you feel most afraid, most uncomfortable, or awkward.",0
"Don’t seek to change others; change yourself. Just mind your own mind and let others mind theirs. Show them who you are through your actions, through your conviction.",0
I would have been eaten by the system.,0
No. I’m talking about the real truth of nature — the only truth — expressed through my belief and the love of my mother.,0
"When we go into the mountains, we say, “No ego, we go.” We venture forth wearing nothing but shorts and shoes, bare-chested against the cold.",0
Everyone is listening. Surviving. And what happens is that everyone begins to feel.,0
I’ve experienced this sensation so many times now that the power for me is in the sharing.,0
"Humans are tribal, and as such, communication with others creates solutions guided by feelings, but rooted in common sense.",0
"Because in the end we are there to be pioneers, to create a new ground in the mind of society, new possibilities.",0
"It’s where I discovered my true resilience, how my mind was able to keep myself still and feeling good despite desperate, even dangerous circumstances.",0
"My ambition is always powered by my mission, my purpose.",0
"You don’t need to venture beyond the Polar Circle or to the middle of the desert to experience this sensation, but you do need to venture beyond your comfort zone.",0
"They’re all biochemical in the end, or at least they translate that way.",0
Who doesn’t want that?,0
". I’m a simple man, and I want to change the world. You see it, eh?",0
We can alter the fate and destiny of our lives and return them back to the soul.,0
"It’s driven by love, and that is what I wish to give to my children and all my beloveds, with respect to all living beings in nature and Mother Nature herself.",0
Reflect on this thought and notice how your body feels.,0
"With practice, your sense of your inner experience, or interoception, will sharpen, allowing you to more consciously observe and control your body and mind.",0
"That was a formative time in my life, and I look back on it with great fondness.",0
"I explored more and more, testing and experimenting, staying out in freezing temperatures all night long wearing nothing but shorts like some kind of lunatic.",0
To take stock of who I was and who I wanted to become. So many of us today are afraid or unwilling to let go.,0
"This has caused us to become too narrow-minded in our perception of the world, which is the opposite of freedom.",0
"It inspired me to create, write poetry, and talk excitedly about all kinds of subjects, from philosophy to culture to the nature of existence, and to express my ideas freely and lovingly through art.",0
"Seekers who are free within become finders. It’s quite impossible to find anything meaningful when you are caught up in the stress of daily life, which can be all-consuming.",0
"And in the wintertime, when it was cold and there was snow on the ground, I would sit naked all night long in one of the courtyards, practicing what would, in time, become my method.",0
"There is nothing shameful about being naked, but hey, I didn’t want to be disturbed, so I sat by myself.",0
All I knew is that it felt great and that I wanted to feel that way all the time.,0
"One time I was doing yoga naked in the courtyard, and one of the women there thought it would be funny to put her feet near my genitals.",0
"But I don’t get aroused if I’m not into it, that’s it. I have power over my own sexuality.",0
They’re all a part of our primordial survival instinct. Hardwired.,0
"My mind really set. Twenty-five deep breaths, a dynamic meditation.",0
"After the twenty-fifth breath, I’d submerge my entire body beneath the icy surface of the water, only keeping my hands on the edge of the hole for guidance.",0
You could easily black out and drown. But that is what I was doing then.,0
"After six or seven minutes, I would feel an urge to urinate, which was a signal to come back up toward the surface.",0
"I’d come out, get dressed, and do my exercises right there by the waterside, completely in control and within myself.",0
"And the more I did it, the stronger this power became.",0
"There she was dancing right in front of me, and I was mesmerized. Just absolutely transfixed. And then, to my astonishment, she came over and sat down next to me.",0
"We were talking and laughing, and it all felt so easy, so natural.",0
"I had gone for a quick dip in the pond there in Vondelpark, and she disappeared. I was heartbroken.",0
We joined hands and danced all the way back through the city to the squatter’s home as if on a cloud.,0
"We just slept together with our clothes on and embarked upon a platonic yet very sensitive relationship, very emotional, very much present.",0
"The connection was so strong, it was clear that nothing more was needed.",0
"That’s how I remember it, at least. And it was beautiful.",0
". She was gone for about five months, and I grew lonely without her.",0
"When she returned, so did the energy between us, and this time the energy manifested itself physically. We became lovers.",0
Olaya remained on my mind and in my heart of course.,0
"A force like hers isn’t soon forgotten, and it took about four or five months for that emotion within me to still.",0
"But soon another letter arrived, and this time it said that she was nearly six months pregnant.",0
"I arrived in Pamplona and was received by Olaya’s family. Her father had these intense blue eyes, and he set them upon me in a way nobody ever had before.",0
I was accepted by the family. They knew my intentions were honorable.,0
"They were talking to each other, and I was following the drift of it all as best I could since my Spanish was not so great.",0
And we returned to Amsterdam together.,0
"I had no money of course, and I was still living in the squatter’s home. But we had love and respect for each other, and we found a way through.",0
"Fortunately for us, health care in the Netherlands is universal, so we didn’t have to worry about the cost of a hospital stay.",0
"We arrived at the hospital around 10:00 p.m., and at 5:00 a.m. sharp, our son Enahm was born. It was March 22, 1983, but I remember it like it was yesterday.",0
"There is a law in the Netherlands that requires parents to register the name of a child within three days of their birth, so I had to go down to the municipality to register him. T",0
"And I don’t want to disappoint them, so I usually play along. But back then I had no name, and now he has A Name (Enahm)! That’s it!",0
"And I think this contributed to him being a very healthy, strong baby, laughing all the time, rarely sick. We had a great time with him.",0
We didn’t worry about this or that as many new parents do. We were not inhibited in any way in our love for him.,0
"And when you have a great time with your baby and the baby is growing nicely, growing strong and happy, the idea of a second baby — and a third and a fourth — makes sense.",0
"I loved Michael Jackson’s music back then, and I still do.",0
"Suddenly I was thrust back into the system I had rejected eight years prior, and my reentry into that world, with its rules and conventions, was difficult.",0
"The children were making too much noise, they said. The whole thing was ridiculous, but it made it clear to me that we needed to make a change.",0
"We packed up the children and the few things we had, and we went to Spain, into the mountains.",0
"A school in Estella, about nine miles to the south, needed somebody who could speak both Spanish and English.",0
"The Basque people have cultural and political differences with the Spanish government, and they have been repressed for a long time.",0
"The Spanish want everything to be Spanish and for Spanish culture to be the dominant culture of the region, but the Basque are a proud people with a rich tradition.",0
"The ETA believed they were fighting for their cultural liberty and freedom, but their methods were extreme.",0
"In the middle of all this political conflict, I remember one night sleeping at Olaya’s parents’ house in Pamplona, on the eighth floor, and dreaming.",0
It was a sickening sight that I will never be able to forget.,0
"Not only did I have little money, but Olaya’s mental state began to deteriorate. The darkness, the shadow, had begun to take shape and was gaining momentum.",0
"My job was bringing in some money, albeit not enough. But the shadow grew and grew, and we couldn’t stay any longer because she wasn’t taking care of the children, and I wasn’t able to do it by myself.",0
"But my Olaya was not there. When she would visit from Spain, I never knew which Olaya I would get.",0
"She was depressed, very depressed, and it was only getting worse.",0
"I practiced my yoga, took my cold baths, did my breathing, my postures, and kept believing that a brighter future was ahead of us.",0
"The children and I loved Olaya deeply, but we could no longer rely on her.",0
The older children had to grow up faster than I would have liked.,0
"Things changed when Javier, a friend I had made in the Basque country, offered me a job leading organized trips for tourists in the Spanish Pyrenees.",0
"The canyons are like live museums, prehistoric museums.",0
"I knew from those experiences that others would enjoy exploring the canyons, so I took a chance and accepted the job with Javier.",0
"The work suited me, and I enjoyed it, but soon I turned my attention to a burgeoning side business.",0
Our children need to climb trees now more than ever. They need to do their Tarzan thing.,0
Something they can’t get from any video game.,0
"The schools are teaching our children history, mathematics, and language, but it’s time for children to also learn about cultivating happiness, strength, and health.",0
"Play is a key. I’m a very playful person, and I loved to play with my children.",0
"At this time, I started a canyoneering venture with Javier. It wasn’t a big operation, but it was enough to sustain myself, to pay the bills.",0
"I had rediscovered the spark of life, but the Olaya I knew was gone.",0
"She was terrorized by her own mind. I needed to be strong for our children, to maintain as stable an environment for them as I could. And I did.",0
"In the summer of 1995, we went back to Spain because I was leading trips into the canyons, and it made sense to have the children nearby, where they could be looked after by Olaya’s family.",0
"I went directly back to Pamplona, and her father took me to see her. I saw her face, and it had been liberated of its shadow.",0
"The love and emotion were still there — they still are to this day — well preserved, strong, and alive.",0
I felt her presence from up in the ethereal hemisphere and knew that she could see that I was doing well with our children.,0
"Do you know what healed me? The cold water. It brought me back into reality. Instead of being guided by my broken emotions toward stress and sorrow, the cold water led me to stillness.",0
"Or maybe it was the other way around. Maybe the cold water made me survive, and my children gave me the strength to heal myself.",0
"You’re not caught up in your thoughts. It’s freezing, and you’re just surviving.",0
"That brought me to a place where I could heal. I loved my children deeply, and they were my salvation.",0
"I was priming and changing my biochemistry in the depths of myself, and I felt cleansed every time I did the breathing exercises. They quieted my mind and filled me with energy.",0
"That was twenty-five years ago, and the method has evolved a lot since then, but its original spark is still with me.",0
"Furthermore, it enables you to respond to the cold in a proactive way, not reactively.",0
"We’d pretty much covered it all on the first day I thought, and these men had little time to waste.",0
"Just before reaching the checkpoint, coming into the base, I looked down at my phone and saw that I had received an email from a doctor, a general practitioner.",0
"I woke up in the hospital, and my brother was there. When we were talking, he told me about you.",0
"We began to do the breathing, and they went very deep within themselves and found a peace that they had never before felt.",0
"“Yes, that’s it,” I said. “That’s the energy we bring into the world.",0
I’m being met by less skepticism than I have in the past (though naturally some are still reluctant to embrace it).,0
"We are not born half, we are born whole, and the way back into that is through the life-force. Can it really be so simple? Just breathing deeply? Is that it? The answer, friends, is yes.",0
It’s as simple as that. It’s like I said at the outset: the breath is a door.,0
Many people who suffer from autoimmune conditions and other debilitating ailments and diseases have benefited greatly from the method.,0
This is not an exaggeration. Reducing inflammation in the body is as simple as breathing.,0
And its benefits aren’t limited only to Crohn’s sufferers.,0
Another forty million or so have reported symptoms consistent with an arthritis diagnosis.,0
"While physical therapy, massage, and acupuncture (in addition to medication) have all helped arthritis sufferers alleviate their pain and discomfort to various degrees, the disease is not believed to be curable.",0
"This is why so many people with arthritis take anti-inflammatory medications and, in severe cases, steroids.",0
Henk van den Bergh is a Dutch blacksmith who lost his mother at the age of fifty-six due to complications stemming from rheumatoid arthritis.,0
"He was in a lot of pain, and he was desperate.",0
"A friend said to him, “Go see Wim Hof,” and figuring he had nothing to lose, he did.",0
"People started to gather around us, and Henk realized that he’d reached a point where he couldn’t turn back.",0
"It was held just a couple of towns over from where he lived, in Blaricum.",0
"It was like a fucking miracle, you know? He was flabbergasted, just sitting there. Later we all went for an ice bath, and when it was his turn, he went in without hesitation.",0
"Despite the irreversible damage to his joints, it’s virtually gone. So thoroughly rehabilitated is Henk that in 2014, he participated in our expedition up Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest peak on the African continent. Amazing.",0
Hof Method with helping manage and in a lot of cases eradicate the debilitating symptoms of various diseases and gain a new lease on life.,0
"Getting into the cold water allows them to find themselves as the captain again — opening to the pain, welcoming it, reframing what it is to have pain, choosing change, not being a victim anymore.",0
You feed off of your own new-found capability.,0
"Commit to it, dedicate yourself to it, especially if you have a severe condition.",0
"The method brings people back to their accountability, their self-awareness, often leading to a thorough change in lifestyle where they take things into their own hands.",0
And that alone merits further investigation.,0
"This shit works, guys. It’s real. So many people have been helped that it’s become too much for me. I can’t count that high.",0
"Large crowds in Munich, Poland, Melbourne, Sydney, Los Angeles.",0
I’m not here a lot because I’m traveling so much — has found relief in the method.,0
"Bertwin came to me suffering from depression and severe backaches that kept him up at night. But after immersing himself in the method, his depression and his backaches are both gone.",0
"Stroe, where I live right now, is the most Catholic, and Christian in general, part of the Netherlands, but I’m not dealing with God here; I’m dealing with the divinity each and every one of us carries within.",0
"But those biological drugs are expensive, man — nearly $3,000 a month for one injection. It’s a big industry.",0
A Polish doctor recently came to our Masters Module as part of our instructor training. He had hoped upon his return to Poland to convince his professor to conduct a study.,0
"If the study or another like it is completed, we will see whether it supports the idea that the method effectively suppresses the IL-6 inflammatory marker.",0
"In America, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) estimate that up to 23.5 million people suffer from autoimmune diseases, and there’s reason to believe that figure is low.",0
The savings would be nearly $800 million annually in the United States alone.,0
"These diseases are modern diseases, Western diseases, that are linked to stress caused by environmental factors, but we don’t have to accept them.",0
"The Jews have a term for it, tikkun olam. It means that we bear a responsibility not only for our own moral, spiritual, and material welfare, but also for the welfare of society at large.",0
"Despite all the healing experiences people report, I know that skeptics remain.",0
"That vision quest is really you, the exploration of the still unventured terrain within yourself.",0
Let me tell you a story. There’s a man I’ve had the good fortune to get to know through this work.,0
He’s got a great spirit. He comes to me one day and says he wants to climb Kilimanjaro.,0
"As it turns out, Frans’s experience on the mountain was transformative. He came down a different man.",0
"He’s giving back and practicing, in his own way, tikkun olam, repairing the world.",0
"And two years later, he went back and summitted Kilimanjaro again, at the age of seventy-eight.",0
Recently I saw a photograph of Frans on Facebook. He was standing in an ice bath while holding two large kettlebells.,0
"The man is an inspiration, a true spirit. I am proud to count him among my friends.",0
"Anna was (and is) a mother of three though, and she simply refused to accept that diagnosis.",0
"Frans and a number of others who have undertaken these expeditions with me, she had no experience with cold exposure or with mountaineering, but neither of those things dissuaded her in the slightest.",0
She’s as happy as she ever was.,0
"So why not you? What else are you looking for? People today are so caught up in their egos, in the chase for material gain or status that they lose sight of who they really are.",0
"You don’t need external validation to try the method. You don’t need anything, really, except love.",0
"That’s what these stories of healing are about. Your blood flow, the life-force, the electricity, they’re all in there.",0
"Your fears are a consequence of a conditioned mind, and they are nothing but a burden.",0
Where would Henk be today if he had given into his fears? Where would Anna be?,0
"Become like a child again — curious, safe. Hold your own hand through this process.",0
"The letters and emails come in every day. “Thank you, Wim Hof,” they say. “Thank you for what you did in my life. You changed it completely. I was on the verge of suicide, but now I’m happy.",0
"This is what we have lost, the motivation for life itself. To realize that we are beautiful, all of us, and that’s what we’re doing here.",0
You bask in it. And you share it. It is very powerful to do the method as a group.,0
"To me, making people feel better is the real purpose in my life. There is nothing that fills me up more than the betterment of any human.",0
"I’m a man on a mission, and I will not fail. Until I die, I will show all the people in the world that we were born to be not only wild, but to be happy, strong, and healthy.",0
"The method will work for you even if you never take an ice bath, even if your breath retention never gets to two minutes, even if your cold shower never gets below 60 degrees.",0
The control I’ve gained through going into nature and coming back is a control that you too can gain with training.,0
"We are the soul, the light. We are bound by its energy, which is love. The love is as straight as an arrow, and I don’t miss.",0
"Present within the cells of all forms of life is a chemical called adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which provides the energy to drive many biological processes, including, in humans, muscle contraction.",0
"How can an athlete, whether they are elite or recreational, achieve this? By breathing. I advise the athletes I consult with to breathe more than they feel they need to and to think of it like a mantra.",0
Aerobic dissimilation creates about thirty times more ATP molecules than are created when there is no oxygen. Just breathe and feel the difference.,0
"I found a way, and it’s coming from nature. From within you. It’s knocking at your door right now.",0
"This, again, is a symptom of a societal issue that has nothing whatsoever to do with the expression of our true nature, of our souls.",0
"How much energy do you want? If you learn to use your mind together with the breathing, you will be able to increase it exponentially. What you do with it after that is up to you, but the possibilities are endless.",0
"They don’t have the means to create more ATP molecules for repair, rehabilitation, or plasticity of the mind and body.",0
"Doing so will increase and accelerate patients’ ability to repair their bodies, and they will feel a lot better than with pharmaceuticals.",0
"That’s nothing new for me though, and it’s one of the reasons why I decided to write this book. I’m grateful to my publisher for giving me this platform because it’s powerful.",0
"At the same time, with deeper breathing, more CO2 is exhaled, the blood pH level becomes more alkaline, and thus more aerobic dissimilation can happen.”",0
"After being exposed to the cold so many times, the neurological pathways in my brain were and remain well-established.",0
"The mind, together with the breathing, can increase your energy levels much more than you ever thought was possible.",0
"Adenosine triphosphate, aerobic dissimilation, mitochondrial processes, the citric acid cycle — whatever you want to call it — just get your energy.",0
"And you know what they say to me? They say, “Within a week of doing the breathing, after years at what I believed was the limit of my performance, I suddenly increased my energy by 10, 15 percent or more.”",0
"In addition to circulating lymph fluid, which returns proteins and fats to the bloodstream throughout the body, the lymphatic system also functions as a kind of waste-management system on a cellular level.",0
"And now, through conscious breathing and the aerobic dissimilation it brings about, we can.",0
"As of this writing he’s the number-six-ranked heavyweight in the Ultimate Fighting Championship, and he credits the Wim Hof Method with improving his conditioning.",0
UFC superstar Alistair Overeem credits the Wim Hof Method with improving his conditioning.,0
"But Alistair stepped into the Octagon in Orlando, Florida, that night and took care of business, dispatching dos Santos by virtue of a technical knockout at the end of the second round.",0
But increased aerobic capacity isn’t the only benefit the method provides to athletes. It also helps them to recover faster.,0
That’s more energy! That’s a more efficient practice. It’s therefore no wonder that Alistair Overeem believes this method can “change the world.”,0
The same goes for Sunday-league and pick-up ballers.,0
"This isn’t to suggest that you will suddenly morph into the second coming of Lionel Messi or LeBron James, but you will see a marked improvement in your endurance and, in turn, your enjoyment of the game.",0
"This enjoyment will only be heightened when you later find that the aches, pains, and fatigue that usually follow a strenuous athletic effort are greatly reduced as well.",0
"Push-ups are only the beginning, and you are limited only by the depth of your imagination. What would you like to do?",0
They acknowledge no limitations. So I press on. I advance. I still do my ice bath every single day because I love it.,0
With my mind. I set my mind so that its neurology has a direct influence on my physical performance.,0
"Despite these gains, my muscles aren’t really growing. That’s not the point of the exercise anyhow.",0
"Their muscles are lean, but they are able to generate tremendous power. Lactic acid builds up in our muscles during intense exercise, causing fatigue, pain, and, eventually, failure.",0
"Diet plays a role in our performance of course, but it’s not everything. Recently, at a retreat at my training camp in Poland, someone said to me, “Yeah, I see you sometimes taking a drink.”",0
"Those who would deprive themselves of simple pleasures like an occasional beer may benefit from it in terms of their short-term performance, but they aren’t nourishing the soul.",0
"Without training or any advanced preparation, I’m going to stand barefoot in the snow for three hours in a horse stance.",0
"But before I do that, I want a beer.”",0
That’s detoxifying muscle that is actively engaged in intoxicating exertion.,0
Performance comes from the feeling that you have all the energy you need to achieve your goal.,0
"Cleanse yourself every day with the method. It’s about the emotion, the connection with your heart, the will to play, the joy, the ease that comes from that.",0
This goes deeper than your story of yourself. What is true success? Living in your heart.,0
"My ideas are not radical, and I’m not superhuman or extraordinary, but I’ve got a strong belief that we are able to change the world.",0
"With every experiment, every publication, we’re rewriting the books, making our case. We’re operating beyond the known limits of science.",0
"The science has evolved, man. The content has changed. We’ve changed.",0
"After our triumph at Radboud, we saw a bit of a spike in interest in what we are doing, but mostly among journalists.",0
There are always going to be cynics and skeptics pushing back against you when you challenge the established order of things.,0
I took advantage of the momentum we were building by engaging in more research.,0
"Not only that, I metabolized four and a half times more energy from my brown fat than the other, far younger test subjects did.",0
"In babies, brown fat plays a key role in both thermoregulation and thermogenesis, creating heat when little babies become cold because they’re not able to move around as much as we do.",0
"But just as muscle atrophies from lack of use, so do our stores of BAT, which diminish when our bodies are not activated or stimulated by the cold.",0
But by now you surely know that I am not like most people my age. Or any age.,0
But what was more interesting to them than the presence of BAT in my body was the way that I was able to use it to generate heat.,0
"While my production of BAT plays a role in my ability to endure the cold, it does not tell the whole story.",0
"Andre is a truck driver by trade, so he lives a somewhat sedentary life compared to me.",0
"Still, genetically, biologically, we are the same. We’re essentially genetic copies of each other, with no discernible phenotypic differences.",0
"After decades of training in the cold, I have developed a different neurology. That’s the power of the mind.",0
I speak of logic because this isn’t magic. The research being conducted on the method is done in the interest of furthering our understanding of human potential.,0
"We can no longer be so narrow-minded in our approach to things, but instead see the bigger picture. Nature is showing us that we cannot trap the knowledge, we have to be the knowledge.",0
You need your mind in it. Realizing the true extent of the power of the mind is just developing neurological pathways that contribute to a new reality.,0
"This is the holy trinity: cold as a mirror, breath as the guide, and mindset as the creator.",0
"Another fifty responded that the method helped drive their cancer into remission. Many more reported relief of their chronic pain. The response, in a word, was overwhelming.",0
"I have now participated in dozens of studies with the researchers at Radboud University and other leading scientific institutions around the world, with great results.",0
"Have you ever heard of the inflammatory disease axial spondylitis, or AS? It’s a scary-sounding disease, and for good reason, as it can cause some of the small bones in your spine to fuse together.",0
The trial was such a success that the AMC now recommends the method as an official “add-on” therapy for those suffering from AS.,0
The researchers were interested to see if perhaps the method could help those who were emotionally blocked by increasing the neural activity in their brains. Would you like to know what happened with the brain scans?,0
"If we truly are able to reverse or significantly curtail depression without pharmacological intervention, we can fundamentally change the way mental health care is practiced around the world.",0
"By the time you read this, there’s a good chance we will have furthered our scientific understanding of the method’s benefits even more. I don’t doubt it.",0
The Mayo Clinic reports that approximately one-third to one-half of women with endometriosis have had difficulty getting pregnant.,0
"I’m not even trying to convince you anymore because if you have read this far, chances are that you have already begun to reach a new understanding of what you thought may be possible.",0
"But it’s important, when you speak about the method, that you make it clear, especially when engaging more conservative minds, that everything is supported by science and that research is ongoing.",0
"There are many more studies coming up, but how many do we need to publish before the scientific establishment acknowledges their findings?",0
Could it be that they view the method in opposition to their own commercial interests? I would prefer not to think that way of course.,0
"But are we into healing, or are we into medicine? That’s what I am asking. If we are into healing, then let’s get to it. Here’s all this data.",0
"Sooner or later, these seeds will blossom. It cannot be controlled or repressed because it is free. It’s not me.",0
"Quite to the contrary, I think criticism polishes the diamond of truth. We’ve got the truth on our side, and it’s a sufficient weapon in the war of ideas.",0
"It’s a privilege to work with your children. When they were little and I would go to the primary school, they wanted me to act normally, but of course I was doing handstands and wearing T-shirts in the wintertime.",0
"Not just one or two, but dozens, hundreds, I don’t know how many.",0
"Now I have a wonderful, beautiful, crazy, mischievous little two-year-old with my partner, Erin. He exudes an almost mystic cuteness when he walks around with his face all like this or like that, and I just melt.",0
"My breakup with his mother really affected me. I was quite down because of it. I was able to perform well, to do all the world-record attempts and everything, but it definitely cast a large shadow over me.",0
"I love the community we are building. I love life in general — to be honest, I’m crazy for it — but these things are like cherries on top of the cake. I’ve been blessed with many cherries.",0
"Most of us still think that disease and illness, both physical and mental, are normal or, worse, inevitable, and that we are powerless to do anything about it.",0
"But disease and illness aren’t normal, and you can do something about them. And now we can, I tell you, we can.",0
"We’ve reversed autoimmune conditions, enhanced athletic performance, and more. We proved it. And now it’s my job to spread the word.",0
"On the contrary, I believe that you should live life as you feel. Intuition and gut feelings have been repressed by dogma and doctrine for too long.",0
"We can become more accountable, more responsible, more able to identify what is good for us and what is not. We are like a computer that needs a reset.",0
"I was alone for five years after I lost Olaya, with no partner. Was I lonely?",0
"Waking up at 4:00 a.m., doing my breathing for an hour, that helped me cleanse myself, to grieve. When you have four kids, you are right there with them, not anywhere else.",0
"It allows you to feel renewed every morning, ready to meet the day with ease and joy and sense of openness. It trains you to be flexible in life.",0
"Getting to work every day with my four eldest children — Enahm, Isabelle, Laura, and Michael — is a great privilege",0
I let go. I make sure to feel the presence of the soul and to radiate it through genuine gratitude and happiness.,0
"A man on a mission is always awake inside, spiritually, to help others. That’s what I do every day. Everything I do is in service of my mission, but still I’m free.",0
"This book is a part of that, and so are all the other things I am doing to help spread this message. Life is crazy and beautiful and full of opportunity, and every day I seize it. Podcasts. Documentaries.",0
"There’s only one truth, you know, and there’s no conjecture, no snake oil to be sold. My mission is to share the love, share the light, and bring solutions not only to help others but also to solve the problems of the past.",0
"Showing people how to access their light is a big part of what I do during the day, but besides that, of course, I breathe.",0
"I don’t care. Repetition is the mother of learning, and I’m banging the drum.",0
"I rise in the morning, and I do my breathing. I don’t do it because it’s good for me, which it is, but because it feels good.",0
"My body is in a deeply stimulated metabolic state, because it has to work to withstand the cold. This makes me feel alive, with an absolute sense of being present — “I am here.”",0
"No. I let the body work, and it’s amazing what it does, what it can do. All the metabolic activity and biochemical processes are priming the body for ultimate functionality.",0
"That might seem impressive, but I know that ten years from now — when I’m in my seventies, a senior citizen — I’ll still be attempting to set all kinds of records and succeeding, just as I always have.",0
". And rabbits of advanced age are still able to flee, fight, find food, and mate. It’s in their nature, and what else is there?",0
How do you feel? I feel fucking nice! That’s the way I choose to live my life every day.,0
"Whatever it takes, I want to feel that this body is serving me. So I do my splits, suspend my body on one arm, balance on or hang from one finger even.",0
"But still there I was, hanging by my middle finger for 23.5 seconds like some kind of lunatic. It was on television, and you can still find the clip on YouTube.",0
"Once you get a taste of that feeling, you crave it. You chase it. You can’t get enough of it. You’re like a man on a mission — never asleep, always available, always alert. Every single day, no matter how long it takes.",0
"Living cells actually adapt in response to these substances (or stressors), positively affecting their condition and functionality.",0
"Naturally, this was a revelation to researchers like Dr. Capel and, I should hope, the larger scientific community.",0
"That may seem farfetched, but the applications of that influence, in terms of disease prevention (think genetic markers) and treatment, not to mention other hereditary factors, are limitless.",0
"Here in the Netherlands, there’s an old saying which, in essence, translates to “I bless your seven past generations and the seven to come.”",0
"When we alter our DNA for the better, the genes we pass along to future generations become an ancestral gift instead of a burden.",0
"The Native peoples — our ancestors — they knew. We came with our Western, colonial minds, dismissing the people living peacefully in harmony with nature as stupid, primitive.",0
"And in doing so, we have the knowledge and technology to make amends with the spirits of the past, here and now. It’s time to awaken to our true nature, which is one of liberation.",0
I believe it is possible to get back to the original cell condition from 3.77 billion years ago.,0
"Those cellular building blocks are present within our bodies, and we are able to restore them to their original shape 3.77 billion years later.",0
"These cells required protection because they are believed to have been “born” in highly acidic, very hot waters. The protective proteins enabled the cells to withstand these extreme conditions.",0
"Those dangers persist outside of our bubbles, of course, but because we rarely engage with them anymore, the chaperone proteins protecting our cells don’t work like they once did.",0
"It’s nothing abstract. We can free the spirits of the past. We can liberate ourselves and, in doing so, free the spirits of our ancestors from their own genetic burden.",0
"I’m sure that sounds like some hippie bullshit, but it’s based in science. Our ancestors were right.",0
"Sounds farfetched, doesn’t it? I admit that it does. But it’s your soul, your light. What are you going to do with it?",0
"Who are you? What are you? You can claim the power of your own mind, claim your destiny. What are you going to do?",0
I see experiences like these all the time in real people’s lives.,0
"We were nearing the ridge atop the mountain that marks the border between Poland and the Czech Republic, and there was a lot of wind. And it just got to him.",0
"He was shaking uncontrollably, and I had to take him to an old customs control house over the border and hug him for a half hour to bring him back.",0
"Collectively, we have lost the native ability to bring harmony, emotionally and spiritually, into the here and now. But what is the purpose of life? Is it for your self-actualization alone?",0
And I argue that they are manifestations of our emotions and the condition of our physicality.,0
"You dial in the combination, open the safe, and free all the spirits that have been locked away within your DNA.",0
Generations and generations. It’s incredible.,0
"These people come to me crying. They’re beautiful people, but they’re repressed emotionally. The breathing opens them up. They go deep within themselves and surrender to the emotion, crying like babies.",0
"In the study, Epel is monitoring three groups: a control group that does nothing, a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) group, and a group that practices the Wim Hof Method.",0
"With that, the telomerases and telomeres (proteins that protect the ends of chromosomes from damage) that influence the length and quality of our lives, keep the cells going.",0
"We do not indulge or compound the trauma but instead address it from a clinical remove, a vantage point from which emotion does not factor. Because the trauma is in the past, it does not manifest as anxiety.",0
"Allow me to take it a step further. When we first go into the cold water, it’s a shock to our system.",0
"But once the mind and body, working in concert, begin to acclimate to this new, extreme environment, they neutralize the magnitude of the cold’s impact.",0
"We are able to survive and move on from traumatic gene expressions in a similar way. Trauma, like the cold water, is beyond our immediate control.",0
"Or we don’t, and they stay locked away. Your parents, grandparents, or great-grandparents may not have been able to deal with their trauma, but they passed it along through their genes.",0
"Their freedom is the conduit to our own as reflected by the soul. It’s up to us to translate its energy. The soul emits light, electricity. If you are able to go into the deepest part of the brain, you come into connection with it.",0
"No more. We are each equipped with the tools to free ourselves, physically and psychologically, from all of this cumulative trauma, and now is the time to get it done.",0
"Because the soul is eternal, there is no beginning and no end, no time or space.",0
"And because there is no beginning or end, there is no death. The soul transcends the body, transcends all matter.",0
"This is the way I have always felt, even before I went into the cold water. I don’t know what it is exactly, but I’m not going to accept all this disease and war, hungry children, cruelty to animals.",0
"The hell with that. No. To make sense of the world, we must return to nature. That’s why I am exploring extremes with my body and mind, going back to science. I’m showing that there’s another way.",0
I don’t mean this in some sort of abstract sense. There’s a logic to it. There is science.,0
"This is what I have been doing for forty years now, but in many ways, I feel as if my journey is only beginning.",0
"Our comfort-zone behaviorism has made us weak. More than that, it’s made us dependent.",0
"Our immune systems have become compromised, leading to disease and disorder. Our biochemistry is out of balance, and we can no longer function as we were meant to.",0
"Through the method, we’ve now found a way to return to our natural state of being. We’ve discovered a way to hop off the hamster wheel and reconnect with the nature within ourselves.",0
"I did all of that to show that I could not only survive but maintain control, even in the most extreme environments and conditions. That’s nature, mine and yours.",0
"If you can be present in this moment instead of dwelling on worry and stress, you can set yourself on a course toward happiness, strength, and health.",0
"But if you can’t (or won’t) and instead allow negative thoughts and energy to direct you, you will only become further alienated and disconnected from that light.",0
Because we have senses that are going outward and we have senses that are going inward.,0
"There’s nothing abstract about it. It’s physics, it’s biochemistry, and it’s your will, which is a neurological muscle. We’re learning how to enter into our own minds.",0
That’s the power of your beautiful mind. It becomes beautiful because you are in command. Where would you like to go?,0
"But just as consciousness requires a neurological awakening and development — a child gaining first awareness of itself and, in time, learning to walk, for example — so does the subconscious need to be awakened.",0
"Cultures throughout time have created practices or rites of passage that seek to connect to a truer sense of reality, the sense of the soul. What is the soul? It is the “you” beyond thinking. It is nature itself.",0
Or maybe you have sensed an energy within yourself that you couldn’t quite identify. That’s your subconscious knocking on your consciousness’s door. It’s part of who and what you are.,0
"Why am I here? What is my purpose? And if your neurological muscle is sufficiently developed, all of your faculties should be ready to serve you.",0
"Your subconscious becomes aware, the unseen becomes seeable, and you at last encounter and, in time, gain control over your senses — all of them.",0
"And though the prevailing thought has been that we cannot control these internal senses, the Wayne State study showed that it is possible to have top-down control over them.",0
"It’s like the old story from the Hindu epic, the Mahabharata, in which five brothers are gathered for an archery lesson",0
"As each brother steps forward to take his shot, the instructor stops him and asks, “What do you see?”",0
"When it’s the youngest brother’s turn, he answers, without hesitation, “I see the eye of the fish.”",0
"The moral of the story is that when we focus on the eye of the fish instead of allowing ourselves to be distracted by the branches and the water, we gain the confidence to take action.",0
It’s the same confidence that propels me toward my mission and that enables me to see it and pursue it with clarity.,0
"Take it and in doing so discover the purpose of your life. Let the light guide you, and go with confidence.",0
Proprioception (or kinesthesia) refers to an awareness of one’s body position and movement through space.,0
"This is what I have been doing all my life, practicing yoga, gaining more focus and body awareness, getting in better tune with my body, learning to trust my body’s intelligence.",0
"There is even evidence that it might just be that infamous “sixth sense,” the “gut feeling” we know we should follow.",0
"It was also long believed that this sense, interoception, was beyond our conscious control. But we are able to influence it.",0
"Here’s what I have observed. Over time, cold exposure and the breathing practice brings you to a more sensitive state.",0
The interoceptive practice of focusing on the heartbeat at the end of this chapter is a great way to develop this.,0
"I did this with my mind, with the power of intention. Trust in your own ability — confidence — combined with alertness puts the body and mind in a state of heightened awareness.",0
"This power lies past the thinking brain. Again, it is a feeling, not a thought.",0
"And if I can suppress an adverse reaction to the stress of cold water on my skin, just think of the broader applications.",0
"That’s the way we should feel every day, and we can — not only be happy, strong, and healthy, but imbued with purpose and a sense of adventure. Your soul comes alive. That’s what the cold water does.",0
"But in an effort to reach as many people as possible, to help people on a worldwide scale — which is my goal — the support of the scientific community is invaluable.",0
"The body should be in balance, but it isn’t. Because of our current lifestyles, we live with permanent low levels of infection.",0
"This is what the author of The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali wrote sixteen hundred years ago or so, more or less. It still holds.",0
"The seer is the witness, the pure consciousness. If you understand that sentence, you don’t have to read all the thousands of sutras that follow it. But if you don’t understand that sentence, you’re fucked.",0
"All of those things, man. None of the spiritual texts I had were in my native language, but I read them. I learned Sanskrit.",0
"I went through all of it, and I still couldn’t understand shit. It was all intellectual.",0
"But in an instant, all those years ago, the cold taught me to silence my thoughts. I began to breathe, deeply and automatically.",0
"According to science, we have no control over our autonomic nervous system — the deepest part of our nervous system. But I challenged that belief.",0
"We showed at Radboud that after just four days of training in the mountains and six days of solo practice at home, the autonomic nervous system could not only be influenced, but accessed deeply and activated.",0
"Yoga is a universal technique, and it still makes sense today. Our understanding of it just needs to be updated.",0
"When I was younger and went seeking a deeper truth, I read the works of all the great yogis past and present, from Patanjali up through Krishnamurti and Osho.",0
"I have been on this path for forty years, but it’s only really been the past twelve years in which the scientific community has begun to come around to these ideas by demonstrating their validity in laboratory studies.",0
"We’re showing it. This isn’t speculative. Like Patanjali wrote, I have become the seer, and I dwell in my own nature.",0
We are going to show that the soul and the love and the power and the strength and the health and the happiness are ours and that all the rest is bullshit. Because it is.,0
This is the secret to our collective enlightenment. Tat tvam asi. There’s a little more mystical Sanskrit for you: “That way thou art.”,0
"And by all means, dive deep. It is a beautiful journey, to immerse yourself in the pursuit of knowledge. But don’t get caught in the mind.",0
"It’s time that we wake up to our senses, to our common sense of love, of protecting each other, and live in harmony with nature. Keep it simple and remember that feeling is true understanding.",0
"I’m serious. Look, I’m a person who used to host tree-climbing birthday parties for neighborhood children. As a boy, I played Tarzan in the forests near my hometown.",0
"I pondered and philosophized. I read a ton of books, but I was searching for something else, a feeling. And then I went into the water. That was my peace, my solace. There was connection — boom — it was there.",0
"You could call it spirituality or transcendence or whatever else you like, but for me it was more about how it felt. It didn’t need a word because I knew what it was.",0
"It’s always been there, and it will show us the way if we let it.",0
To what our true nature is telling us.,0
"Hell, man, we are the horse. But deep down we just want to be. Without the noise of outside voices, without the distractions of life.",0
"To give yourself over to the power it wields, however illogical it appears because, as they say, the heart wants what it wants. Don’t I know it.",0
I wrote back in chapter 3 about how the modern human brain experiences significantly less blood flow into its deeper parts than the brains of our prehistoric ancestors.,0
"It would be like the desert after the rains come. Suddenly, within a few days, it’s all colors. The seeds of life were there all along.",0
I’ll tell you what I do. I follow my inner voice and listen to what it tells me. I trust my soul sense and let it guide me.,0
But my inner voice tells me to bloody get into that cold water because it is calling me to embrace every bit of my being.,0
"The key is being able to tell which one is the angel and which one is the devil. Most people can’t make this distinction, or they don’t want to, because the truth is uncomfortable.",0
They don’t want to step off the racetrack because they have found comfort in its predictable contours.,0
They’d rather intellectualize than feel because feeling makes them vulnerable. They can’t control the outcome. They can’t explain it with words.,0
"Every day I follow it back into the water, and I know it’s good. Once I get in, the noble nature of the cold gets at me with all the might of the earth and becomes a tender touch, very intimate.",0
"Because when I go into the cold, the deepest parts of my brain, like the brain stem, which governs the survival instinct, receive blood flow.",0
"And when I get out of the water, I feel alive, as if I have experienced a rebirth.",0
You start to love that stress and what it does for you. Hormetic stress in this form is exhilarating and beneficial.,0
"Anxiety heightened by congestion, sitting there every day, unable to deal with that stress, becoming annoyed.",0
"Of course, follow the protocols as outlined in chapter 3: thirty seconds, forty-five seconds … you understand.",0
There are no tyrannical bosses or heartbreaking divorces in the ice bath. The cold water is the boss.,0
And it’s strong. That’s what I found on Mount Everest when I was lost in a whiteout in my shorts.,0
"There was nobody else around, it was freezing cold, and there was little oxygen. But despite all of that, I remained calm. I felt no stress, and that was my mind.",0
My left foot was frostbitten. I wasn’t scared. I wasn’t anxious. I gained control.,0
"In a moment in which everything was seemingly out of control, my mind took control, through the breath.",0
"We’ve developed the ability to launch rockets and people to the moon, but we’re not able to maintain our own happiness, strength, and health?",0
Are you in command? Are you living up to the light in your soul? Are you making sense to yourself? No?,0
Understand beyond words. Know. The spirit is inside of you. Just open up to it and direct its light to others.,0
"This spirituality is inherent in us and our innate neurological pathways, but somehow we lost our ability to find it, like the people in the story in which the wise men decide where to put the soul.",0
"But not only East and West, but North and South, Above and Below.",0
"But whatever the symbols, we move beyond religion and instead rely on science to show the way.",0
"Toward what? Toward moksha, liberation, samadhi, the prima, liberty. Awakening to the flow of our subtle energy, ki, qi, prana. It’s all there for you if you want to be free.",0
"Are you okay with maybe, you know, only being free on the weekends? Do you have time for freedom?",0
"The power of the mind is incredible. It has top-down command over your body and all of the senses. It is able to command the seen and the unseen, the visible and invisible.",0
"Spiritual systems across the world recognize a subtle energy within us, the electricity that flows up and down the spine and throughout the body.",0
But it’s your decision how far you go. Do you want peace in your mind?,0
Forget studying difficult languages and going into a cave for twenty years. Just breathe on the sofa in the morning before breakfast.,0
"They think it is too simple to work. They ask me, “How do you do it, Wim? Is it with the nose, or the mouth?",0
"And I say, “It doesn’t matter what kind of hole you use here, just get it in!” Go easy. Don’t think so hard about these things, just get the breath in. Into the belly, the chest, and the head — and let it go.",0
"Some people are so in their head that they have to relearn how to feel, to train their interoceptive sense of their internal experience.",0
"The body wants nutrients, oxygen, and vitamins, and it wants light. The breath ignites our inner electricity.",0
"That is liberation, and we can do it consciously. Isn’t that amazing? You can do it with just twenty minutes of breathing.",0
"You transcend your thoughts. There is no doubt anymore. You become everything. It’s right here, right now.",0
The breath and the cold take you to the depths of yourself,0
"As I said in chapter 4, if you do Wim Hof breathing in a group setting, the experience is intensified. Humanity was birthed into the tribe.",0
The simple act of breathing together allows the emotions to come to the surface faster. It is this simplicity itself that allows space for a nonjudgmental state of mind that beckons a shared vulnerability.,0
These breathing techniques are so simple and so effective that all you have to do to reclaim your genetic destiny is push the button.,0
You condition your blood flow to go deep into the brain. Then you can use the breath and the power of the mind to cleanse your past emotions and your trauma.,0
Those are the chitta vrittis (distracting thoughts) and the kleshas (poisonous emotions) in the old yoga.,0
"And on and on. With the method we have demystified all this and brought it up to date, helping to bring the science of yoga into the modern age.",0
"We are all kings and queens, and we should behave like it. We should be proud.",0
"Your kingdom, of course, is you, yourself. There’s no castle. You are the castle. The universe is contained within you, and you are capable of doing extraordinary things.",0
"What do you think? How do you feel? Are you excited to explore deeply within yourself, gain awareness, and take control? Why?",0
What will you do with the abundance awaiting you within?,0
"Consumed by the reality and stress of daily life, you entertained no such notions.",0
"The real spirit, the real experience of your mind and your body is one of happiness, strength, and health.",0
"That’s who you are. That’s how you will find not only peace, but bliss. Yes, the breath is a door. But love welcomes you inside.",0
"Critics and skeptics will, of course, say that I’ve got my head in the clouds, that I should be practical, that I should just shut up already.",0
"I’m sending these signals into the hemispheres, into the ethereal world, into the past.",0
"The past, present, and future are one, and you can access them like going into a library and picking out the right book.",0
"It is your birthright to be happy, strong, and healthy. Your destiny is yours, my friends, and you can find it in the breath.",0
"And if you follow the flow of that energy with conviction and with love, you can bypass and transcend all of the scriptures and their repressive dogmas.",0
"You are the witness, the seer, as Patanjali wrote nearly two thousand years ago.",0
"You can silence the modifications of the conscious mind and dwell within your own nature. So, what are you waiting for?",0
These restrictions work in opposition to our nature. Dogs need to run free just as children need the freedom to play and explore.,0
"When we release our minds from the bondage of dogma, the stress of daily existence, and our perceived limits, we can glimpse a new world where love and harmony with nature prevail.",0
"That’s why we live in a world marked by war, poverty, hunger, disease, and suffering.",0
"We have stepped out of the light, purposefully, and into chaos. It’s not sustainable.",0
"But now the time has come for us to reclaim what we have lost, to harness the consciousness, and to direct it back toward the light and rediscover the soul.",0
"Our purpose can be to spread love and happiness far and wide, bring peace through conscious action, and return to a state of harmony with the nature from which we have evolved.",0
"This is how we will change the world, one soul at a time, altering the collective consciousness by awakening to our own boundless potential.",0
We are limited only by the depth of our imagination and the strength of our conviction.,0
"Our minds will take us on a journey toward true selfactualization in which we will convert the subconscious into the conscious and the soul into light. It may take us a while, but that’s us.",0
Take a cold shower. Do the breathing. Activate your vascular system. Change your biochemistry. Follow the breath. Lean into it.,0
"Let go of your ego and instead reflect that which connects us, which is love. Let go of your thoughts and your stress and open up to your heart.",0
"Let go and allow your soul to rise in your consciousness. The soul is eternal, indestructible, and perhaps most importantly, incorruptible.",0
Let go and become the king or queen you were meant to be. I know you can do it. I believe in you.,0
"This book has been a universe unto itself. So many beautiful figures have played their role. The diamond of the depths, distilled into a book, carefully polished, finally shown.",0
"To Tami Simon, of Sounds True, who recognized the space people need to go deep and, consequently, made it possible to get the depth to the people.",0
"Jennifer Yvette Brown, who wandered around the labyrinth of words and turned stones into flowers, opening up the eyes of everybody who worked on the book, giving light touches to heavy matters.",0
All of you have worked on this with the patience of monks in a monastery — sacred the energy. My gratitude goes to all of you.,0
Their work has led to an absolute new horizon of what humans are capable of.,0
"They are seekers, helping bring that which is hidden into the light. And there is more to come. I trust my gut feeling to know more than my consciousness is able to see.",0
"To Dr. Elissa Epel, who delighted my heart by writing the foreword of this book. A brilliant scientist and an absolute shining light who is bringing the Wim Hof Method into a new realm.",0
"I thank you not only for your support, but for sharing the soul. You are the soul of this movement. You are the heart.",0
"And to you, my dear reader, I acknowledge you. It is time to go home, to where we recognize our true being together. Happiness, strength, and health are the moral values of our being, and they are back.",0
She only wants care. I only want care. I care for you. We care for each other.,0
"For example, you can focus on deeper, more conscious breathing any time during the day.",0
The method should be implemented in your life daily to reap the full benefits.,0
"Since the Wim Hof Method moderates the immune response, it is most effective with conditions that arise from an underlying disturbance to the immune system.",0
There has been considerable scientific research into the Wim Hof Method and its effects on various health conditions.,0
"There are, however, hundreds of thousands of conditions and diseases.",0
"For the majority of ailments, we do not have the requisite knowledge to be able to speak with authority on the potential of the WHM as an effective treatment.",0
"Ultimately, the best — and really the only — way to find out what the Wim Hof Method does for you personally is to give it a try.",0
"If you have a chronic health condition or are currently ill, consult with a medical professional before implementing the Wim Hof Method.",0
The Wim Hof Method can be practiced by every healthy individual. Listen to your body and never force the practices.,0
We do not know if the changes in biochemistry associated with the WHM techniques adversely affect the health of the baby.,0
"When the baby is born, you are safe to resume practicing the Method.",0
"Many families enjoy practicing the WHM method together. Children’s brains are still developing, however, and they are not equipped with the self-regulation necessary to assess any risks associated with the method.",0
"Please be careful with regard to cold exposure, and build this up gradually.",0
"Thus, we advise that children under the age of sixteen are supervised by a parent or legal guardian, and are never compelled to practice the method against their will.",0
"If you want to receive the benefits of the method, yes. Staying in our “comfort zone” weakens our system and ends up hurting us in the end.",0
Your body will soon begin to warm up faster after cold exposure sessions.,0
"But take it gradually. Enjoy your warm shower thoroughly, and increase your cold exposure time at the end only as you are ready.",0
"Lastly, doing the horse stance exercise when you get out of the shower will heat you up from the inside out and help you keep your focus.",0
You can experiment with extending your exposure time a bit if your water temperature falls in this zone.,0
"Cold exposure boosts the release of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter involved in focus, attention, and mood.",0
"Norepinephrine also acts as a hormone, promoting vasoconstriction and thus decreasing the total surface area by which heat is lost to its surroundings.",0
"The greater the jump in temperature, the more norepinephrine is released.",0
It therefore follows that going from hot to cold repeatedly could augment the benefits received from this neurotransmitter.,0
"The effect is thought to be more pronounced with more extreme swings, such as alternating between ice bath and sauna.",0
"Although alternating between hot and cold exposure is a time-honored practice in many cultures, research on it is lacking, and conclusive findings have yet to be established.",0
We recommend the standard three to four rounds in the morning before breakfast as a regular practice.,0
Try a round in the mid-afternoon if your energy starts to wane.,0
Extended retention time is not necessary to receive the health benefits of the method.,0
"If you lose consciousness from holding your breath out, you are taking the practice too far.",0
"Inhale once you feel the urge to do so. Listen to your body, not the ego!",0
Is it necessary to take the cold shower directly after the Basic Breathing exercises?,0
"The effects are typically expressed most distinctly in the hands and feet, but can extend across the entire body.",0
"No, but doing the breathing practice first can help with your mind-set and cold tolerance.",0
"Barring any preexisting medical conditions, this phenomenon is entirely harmless, and the effects dissipate within minutes.",0
"Over time, it may no longer arise at all. If the sensation is painful, please consult a medical professional.",0
"If you are not able to shower directly after, you can do a mini breathing exercise before you step into the cold shower — thirty deep breaths while focusing on your intention.",0
"This effect is known as “tinnitus,” a condition with a wide range of causes and manifestations.",0
"You may experience involuntary muscle contraction, known as “tetany.",0
"Conversely, those dealing with chronic tinnitus often find relief from its concomitant anxiety in the calming effect of the breathing techniques.",0
"The breathing exercises also increase neural activity in the auditory brainstem, where the brain processes sounds, possibly causing auditory nerve cells to become over-excited.",0
"We have found that in the vast majority of cases, the ringing disappears with repeated breathing practice.",0
"If you find that, after several weeks, the noise persists or intensifies, some underlying physiological condition may be at play, in which case we recommend you consult a medical professional.",0
"For some people, practicing the WHM either induces or exacerbates the ringing, while for others it changes the pitch.",0
"The scientific community continues to grapple with the particulars of tinnitus, but has established that the phenomenon itself is harmless.",0
The connection between tinnitus and the Wim Hof Method has various possible causes.,0
"A rare infectious disorder that is a severe form of the
bacterial infection caused by Leptospira bacteria known as leptospirosis.

Learn to let it be. This is a phenomenal way to subtly observe the neural activity of your brain.,0
"Keep following your breath, and turn your inner focus to the center of your forehead, the “third eye.”",0
"Be patient. In this way, your energy is able to disconnect from the external perception of the visual cortex and go into the deeper realms of the brain.",0
Just look at what you see with your eyes closed. Don’t try to see anything in particular.,0
Now all there is for you to do is relax and breathe. Just drop everything and get into this breathing. We are all lightworkers. Work with the light and get free.,0
"Close your eyes, follow your breath, witness yourself calming down.",0
"You say you have stress, tension, all that mental shit? Whatever you are thinking, I don’t care. Let it go. Let it go.",0

"Breathe out with a sound like “Hum,” “Ah,” or “Om.” Make whatever sounds make you happy.",0
Breathe in deeply.,0
Settle yourself somewhere comfortable.,0
Set a timer for one minute.,0
And it’s like a massage for your spine from within — all the way up to your brain stem and to the center of your head. It brings you directly inside your body.,0
It taps into your parasympathetic nervous system — where the peace is inside — and calms down your hectic sympathetic nervous system.,0
What I do for stress is one minute of humming and breathing. This always works for me.,0
"Try it now with a timer. If you’re breathing between fifteen to twenty times a minute, you are stressed.",0
You can tell if you are stressed by counting how many times you breathe in a minute.,0
They really are dead lines! Stress deregulates our system.,0

A couple of minutes per day is enough to help you deepen this connection and reap the benefits of it.,0
This is connecting your mind and your body. This is interoceptive focus.,0
"If you focus on your hand, feel the heartbeat there, and if you focus on your feet, feel the blood flow from your ankles to your toes.",0
Make a journey through your body and try to feel the heartbeat in different parts of it.,0
Reconnect with your heartbeat and try to synchronize your breath with it again.,0
"Imagine how your blood provides oxygen and nutrients to organs and muscles, and transports waste products (like carbon dioxide) to your liver, kidneys, and lungs.",0
Now visualize your circulatory system.,0
Connect with your heartbeat and try to synchronize your breath with it so that you can feel it everywhere.,0
"But if we channel our interoceptive focus to it, we can decrease our heart rate during times of stress, which not only serves to relieve that stress but also to improve the absorption of oxygen and nutrients within our cells.",0
"Because the heartbeat is involuntary, few of us pay much attention to it or to the circulatory system it serves.",0
In this exercise we are going to forge a conscious connection with the heart and circulatory system.,0
"After a few more breaths, visualize the exchange of gases in your body.",0

"School was harsh, both theoretically and socially.",0
"When you extend exposure to the cold by going into an ice bath or open body of water, it is an intense experience.",0
"Instead, do long, conscious, exhalations to bring your breath into a controlled, steady rhythm. Take deep breaths through the nose and try to relax.",0
"If you want to try an ice bath or a cold plunge, make sure you are being safe and smart about it.",0
"The cold is our warm friend, our mirror, and our teacher. It can also be dangerous.",0
Try letting out a long “Hummmmm” on the exhale.,0
"For a thorough training in safe cold exposure, please visit wimhofmethod.com to sign up for one of our courses or workshops.",0
"How will it make you feel? Imagine how you will enter the water, be it a bathtub or a lake, and how you will feel when you do it. Assume a can-do mindset.",0
Embrace the cold; let it take you to the depths of yourself. Do NOT perform the WHM basic breathing technique.,0
"First, find someone to share this experience with you. Ice baths and cold plunges are safer and more fun with friends.",0
Prepare yourself by doing one or two rounds of the basic breathing exercise as you visualize the cold water.,0
"Confidently enter the water while taking deep, calm breaths. Focus on your breath.",0
"To befriend the cold at home or in the wild, follow these steps:",0
That’s where the best weed is: inside. We can grow it in our own minds.,0
Getting into the cold in nature—there is nothing like it. And taking an ice bath is an amazing way to show yourself what you are capable of.,0
We have scientifically proven that the endocannabinoid system can be consciously activated.,0
"So while weed is nice, I prefer to breathe and get into the cold.",0
"But if you are able to get high on your own supply, that’s even better, don’t you think?",0
People ask me all the time what I think about weed. I think weed is great. Cannabinoids have many helpful benefits.,0
Think of the painful sensation as a signal. Motivate yourself to listen to this signal and become attuned to it.,0
Release your breath and all tension,0
"Now take twenty more deep breaths. Fully in, and letting go. Do not force your breath.",0
"Additional surgeries did not improve my situation, and I suffered from chronic pain and physical limitations every single day.",0
"This signal tells you that the chemistry in this area needs to change, or is changing.",0
"Then take five calm, deep breaths.",0
Tense the muscles around the pain area as well.,0
"When practicing the WHM for pain regulation, you’re consciously manipulating your body and the pain you feel through the use of the breathing techniques.",0
A positive train of thought or mindset influences the perception of pain.,0
Begin by sitting or lying down in a comfortable position.,0
"While holding the breath, focus your attention on the point of pain, and press your held breath toward it.",0
My life changed when a medical mistake was made during an artificial hip operation.,0
"The purpose is not to suppress the pain signal, but to change the internal chemistry that causes the pain in the first place.",0
"But then I was introduced to the Wim Hof Method, and my life changed completely.",0
"It provided me with the insights and skills I needed to improve the quality of my life fundamentally, despite the pain and limitations.",0
"Exhale the last breath fully out, then inhale fully in once more, and hold it for ten seconds.",0
"How long can you hold a horse stance, with or without beer? Let’s find out!",0
"Concentration, breathing, and cold training allows me to produce the morphine-containing hormones and cannabinoids that reduce the experience of the pain.",0
"To get into a horse stance, stand up straight, then spread your feet apart, about one and a half times the width of your shoulders.",0
Pain is a complex phenomenon that can have a penetrating effect on life.,0
"Make sure that your feet are facing forward, your spine is straight, and your posture is upright and aligned.",0
It can have an adverse effect on one’s work and relationships.,0
"Pain may be a fixed value in life, but it is possible to control it with the Wim Hof Method.",0
"Daily pain often results in a negative spiral that can lead to depression, isolation, and a reliance on medication.",0
"Now bend your knees into a squat, lowering your upper body as if you were on horseback.",0
Keep your knees in line with your toes. Place your hands on your hips. And hold.,0
"I also like to add arm movements and sounds — pushing my right hand away from my body to the left side, then switching to push out with my left hand to the right side, making “Hoo-Hah” sounds as I breathe.",0
But employing the WHM enabled me to stop taking medication and instead influence my pain in a natural way.,0
"Then, the second time around, breathe deeply and evenly and see the difference it makes.",0
First breathe regularly and see how long you can hold the stance.,0
Athletic performance isn’t the only kind of performance that is enhanced by practicing the method.,0
"Ever since I’ve been instructing the Wim Hof Method, I’ve been using it to upgrade all kinds of facets of daily life.",0
"Doing deep breathing will help, as it lessens the build-up of lactic acid in your muscles, which leads to fatigue and failure.",0
One of my favorites is to use breathwork to elevate the sexual experience.,0
"If it can enable a man to drop down and do forty push-ups after just one round, imagine how it might benefit you between the sheets.",0
"In our WHM retreats, we often use this exercise to stay warm after being in cold water.",0
"I’ve found that the state of mind it generates, in combination with the extra energy created in your cells for longer stamina, and the activation of primordial powers from our lizard brain, can make for some serious fireworks.",0
I’ve found that this is a unique and tender way to align with my partner.,0
"Jelle Steenbeek, creator of the Lionwood program, is a WHM instructor who has found that practicing WHM breathing with his sexual partner enhances the experience for them both.",0
"With energy of the group to carry them, people are easily able to hold the stance for thirty minutes.",0
Holding my spouse by the chest while sitting behind her against some pillows and doing three or four rounds of breathing requires that we are both on the same team,0
WHM practice also trains my perineal muscle each time I “squeeze” in the second retention of a breath cycle.,0
"At each “plateau,” you stop at 80 percent, do the breathing, and start over.",0
"Plus, more feeling over your body is more control over your equipment.",0
"This is one of the most important muscles for a good sex life, for both men and women.",0
"If you stop each time you are there and don’t go over the edge, you are able to get to much higher states of orgasmic joy.",0
"You don’t start again from zero; you have a higher base to launch from, which gets you higher.",0
Don’t even get me started on ice baths in relation to better sex and children named after Wim!,0
Another thing breathing helped me to do is slow down and give my partner more time to enjoy herself.,0
"To demonstrate the power of the technique, let’s do some push-ups. First, do as many push-ups as you can to set a baseline.",0
"If you feel you can, keep doing the push-ups after you breathe in for the recovery breath.",0
Most of us can only do ten or twenty before becoming seriously fatigued.,0
"As a man, if you get heated and keep going, it is very likely you’ll orgasm if you go beyond 80 percent of excitement.",0
Breathe in deeply and relax to let your breath go sixty times.,0
This exercise is an adaptation of the Basic Breathing Exercise to enhance athletic performance.,0
"You may be surprised to learn that suddenly you can do twice, three times, or four times as many as you did before.",0
"Now do a single round of the Basic Breathing Exercise, exhale fully, and try the push-ups again during the retention phase, with your breath held out on the exhale.",0
Relax to let your breath go and start a new round.,0
"Start each new round with your regular WHM breathing rhythm, and then increase the speed and intensity of your breathing as the round proceeds.",0
"You can delay the deprivation of oxygen in the muscle tissue, thereby postponing the point of lactic acidification, which leads to fatigue and failure.",0
Wait a couple of minutes to ground yourself again and then begin your endurance exercise.,0
The Wim Hof Method uses your body’s own ability to recalibrate and refocus so you can perform at your peak.,0
Breathe more than you feel is necessary and stay aware of your breath during the endurance exercise.,0
"Before you begin an endurance exercise, such as long distance running or cycling, do three to four rounds of power breathing:",0
This increase is what makes this power breathing.,0
Say goodbye to performance anxiety and game-day jitters.,0
The breathing exercise causes a release of adrenaline and glucose that your body can absorb immediately and achieve better performance.,0
"In January 2020, I joined Wim Hof and a number of other authors and influencers for one of his expeditions in Poland.",0
I think there’s an incredible application here for professional athletes.,0
"I want to be able to get more out of my body than anybody has, ever.",0
"I now do the Wim Hof basic breathing every single morning, using the free app.",0
"After the third round of breathing, I feel freaking great, like it gets my brain right for the day.",0
"I think supplements and exercise are amazing, but I don’t think anything is more amazing than doing this breath work first thing in the morning.",0
"Since the expedition, my sleep has dramatically improved, my recovery is off the charts, and because I’m hyper-saturated with oxygen in my body, I don’t hit fatigue until a lot later when I’m training.",0
I don’t want to just take care of my body. I don’t want to just live longer.,0
"In 2015, I was diagnosed with an aggressive, rapidly dividing form of breast cancer that required six months of chemotherapy, six weeks of radiation, and a breast-saving operation.",0
All you have to do is lie in your bed and let Wim guide you.,0
"It’s just about being able to access more of the gifts that God has given you, to help you gain a tool that helps you become your greater self.",0
"At the end of seventeen minutes, there is a recalibration in your mind, a chemical change in your brain from this breathing technique.",0
"Naturally I continued with the Wim Hof Method, and I ended up feeling less tired and more energetic than I had the whole previous year.",0
"I already practice cold exposure, so it was the breathing part that was key for me.",0
"When I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) in 2011, the ground beneath my feet subsided.",0
"During the workshop, I already got tingling in my fingers during the breathing exercises.",0
"The WHM has taught me to really listen to my body, which makes me powerful.",0
My neurologist told me that nothing would change and that I would have to learn to live with this handicap. But then my mother told me about Wim Hof.,0
"Today my MS is under control; I am an active mother of five, work full time in the Netherlands Philharmonic Orchestra, train, and live life as I would like to live it.",0
"Now I hold workshops twice a month in my hometown of Ibiza, where I live in remission of my cancer.",0
So they weren’t “dead” after all. There was life in them.,0
It brings me such joy to share my happiness with others and to see them benefit from the method as well. I’m truly blessed.,0
"I called my husband at the time and said, “A miracle has happened.”",0
"Our fourth child was ten months old, and the symptoms affected my hand and arm, making it impossible for me to perform in my profession as a violinist.",0
The WHM has made me strong both physically and mentally.,0
"I then decided that I wanted to share my knowledge and experience with the WHM with others, so a year later, I became a certified Wim Hof Method instructor.",0
"From that day on, I continued to practice the WHM, and in a short amount of time, my hand and arm recovered 99 percent.",0
"For years I experimented with diet and nutrition, sport and exercise, yoga and meditation.",0
"By following Wim’s ten-week online course, I found a way back into my body and some deep healing took place over a matter of weeks.",0
"Even a beginner can construct these royal sailing boats. Model builders from ages nine to adult will find the instructions and patterns easy to understand, easy to copy, and most important—great fun to construct!",0
The boat model was also valued in Egyptian culture as a religious symbol.,0
"The finest funerary boat models were discovered in Egypt, and the most valuable are the ones belonging to King Tutankhamen (ruled 1361-1352 B.C).",0
These Egyptian model boats were known as funerary models.,0
"Also described is how to make the beautiful royal sail using freehand painting techniques, and how to make the miniature hieroglyphic symbols for each model",0
"These boat models are 3’ long and made of acacia wood and ivory. Even after thirty-five centuries, these models still retain their colorful decorations and fine linen sails. They are classic examples of Egyptian maritime art and technology.",0
"They believed the soul, upon leaving the body, would then journey on a boat to heaven.",0
"He organized the construction of the pyramid, but not much else is known about Khufu’s life due to the fact his tomb was robbed soon after his death. N",0
"The hobbyist building these royal boat models will be following the process that the ancient Egyptians used to construct their boats many centuries ago. The modern model shipwright will learn how to select the finest wood, the best tools, and replicate the paints and colors favored by the ancient Egyptians.",0
"To transfer the design onto the sail material, place the sail pattern under the blank sail sheet and gently trace the outline on the papyrus or parchment using a #2 pencil.",0
"King Khufu, who reigned from approximately 2551 to 2528 B.C., was a 4th Dynasty pharaoh who was best known for building the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt.",0
It was in accordance with this hope that the dead person’s family would place a model of a boat in the burial place so the soul would find its way to heaven.,0
"These instructions relate to all three model-building projects, even though many centuries separate each pharaoh’s reign. As stated previously, the projects are rated at a beginner’s skill level. However, it is recommended that adult supervision be present when children under the age of twelve are using cutting tools.",0
The paints are water-based acrylic and can be easily removed with water.,0
"No remains of his mummy have ever been found, only the empty sarcophagus that lies in the center of the king’s chamber inside the pyramid. Khufu’s Great Pyramid is the only remaining Wonder of the Ancient World standing to this day.",0
The sail is now ready for mounting. Place the sail to the side for now while the next phase of construction begins.,0
There are only two things necessary for you to do in order to make the pharaoh’s sail. The first requires tracing the pattern in the book onto either the papyrus sheet or the parchment paper. The second is to paint the outline of the images on the papyrus or parchment.,0
He is considered by many historians to be one of the great pharaohs of Egypt.,0
"For best results use small bristle camel’s hair brushes: very fine, fine, ″, and ¼″.",0
"Then go over the pencil markings with a medium brown, extra-fine point, felt-tip pen. Then paint the sail following the color guide provided for each sail using the water-based acrylic paints listed under Supplies and Construction Materials on page 2.",0
Many of the models were lovingly constructed as toys for their children two thousand years before the birth of Christ.,0
Two sheets of either light colored papyrus paper or top-grade beige parchment paper. (NOTE: Inexpensive papyrus paper can be obtained from importers listed on the Internet.),0
"All that remains of this once powerful pharaoh is a nine-millimeter ivory statuette of him that was discovered at Abydos, Egypt.",0
"It should be noted that each pharaoh’s sail design and coloring is different. The reason for this is that the art style did change over the centuries separating these great pharaohs. This book provides the necessary patterns and easy-to-follow instructions on how to create each sail in Parts 1, 2, and 3.",0
Larger boats like a pharaoh’s sailing boat were made from native acacia wood and imported cedar from what is now the country of Lebanon.,0
The varnish will protect the paint and sail material from being damaged while handling and mounting the sail to the model’s yardarm and mast.,0
"The model builder should have a solid, well-lighted worktable for this project. You will also need a good-quality cutting mat and a flexible steel ruler in order to make safe and accurate pattern cuts using an X-ACTO knife. Many of these materials can be easily obtained at craft, hobby, and office supply stores.",0
"King Khufu probably used his boat for important state and religious functions and also excursions on the Nile with his wives, concubines, and children.",0
Use a paper towel to clean off any excess paint from the brush.,0
The sail’s 5 ″ side will be the length; the sail’s 4 ″ side will be the width. It is recommended that you cut out an extra piece to use as a practice piece for the painting of the sail.,0
"During Khufu’s time there were many types of boats traveling along the Nile River. The most common boats were made from lightweight papyrus reeds. They were used for personal transport, light commerce, fishing, hunting, and, of course, warfare.",0
Cedar was very important to the Egyptians as a boat building material.,0
"Refer to the patterns on pages 23 and 25, and the drawings on pages 19, 20, and 21 before starting this portion of the project.",0
"The most common models the Egyptians made were boats. Today, in museums and private collections throughout the world, thousands of these historic artifacts are on display.",0
"In addition, the boat might have had a large square sail made of thick coarse canvas gloriously painted with Khufu’s likeness standing with the God Osiris, or perhaps the Goddess Mut.",0
"Once you are satisfied that all the details on the pharaoh’s portrait and the hieroglyphic writing are complete, allow the paint to dry for two hours before applying a light coat of clear water-based satin varnish to both sides of the sail.",0
"Take a 7¾″ x 11¾″ sheet of light colored papyrus or a sheet of beige parchment paper and, using an X-ACTO knife, carefully cut out a 5 ″ x 4 ″ piece from the blank sheet.",0
This part of making the sail is fun. You will find that acrylic paint is easy to work with when reproducing the pharaoh’s likeness and royal cartouches. Another great thing about acrylic paint is when it is dry the colors will closely resemble the heavily leaded paint used by ancient Egyptian artists.,0
"Khufu’s royal boat was built of relatively short blocks of timber that were braced and secured with strong rope made of halfa grass, wooden dowels, and copper staples.",0
"Begin by painting the outlines carefully with short, steady strokes using the ″ brush with just a small amount of paint each time.",0
"Once the outlines are painted, allow them to dry thoroughly before using the very fine and fine brushes to paint the small details like the facial features and costumes.",0
"Once the outline has been traced, gently retrace the pharaoh’s image using a medium brown, extra-fine point, felt-tip pen so all the lines and hieroglyphs will stand out for the painting phase. If mistakes are made here in this process, use the spare sail material to start over again.",0
The top piece for the footing measures ¼″ x ¼″ x ¼″. Glue the pieces together in a stack. Refer to the drawing on page 20 for the correct placement of the mast-footing base on the main deck.,0
"Carefully use an X-ACTO knife to cut the patterns out. The hull is made sandwich style. (See the drawing on page 19 as a guide.) Starting with the left side of the boat’s keel (using white carpenter’s glue): glue number 1 to the boat’s keel at the top. Next, glue number 2 to number 1, then glue number 3 to number 2, then, finally, glue number 4 to number 3.",0
"The pharaoh’s throne platform can be made from balsa, walnut, or basswood. The measurements are: x 1½″ x 1 ″.",0
"Place the 5 ″ x 4%″ sheet squarely over the outline guide on page 11. Use a #2 pencil to gently trace the image onto the sail material. The image may appear light now, but once it is placed under a good light source the lines will be easily seen for the final tracing before the actual painting of the sail.",0
"The bi-pole mast is 5½″ long and is supported by three, thick strips.",0
"All of the patterns are labeled for you on pages 23 and 25. Trace the patterns onto whatever wood you want: balsa, mahogany, walnut, etc. The wood should be a thick sheet.",0
The yardarm is made of a single piece of wood dowel. Follow the scale drawing on page 21 to make this piece.,0
Refer to the painting instructions on page 11 and the color photograph of the completed sail located on the inside front cover as a guide for what colors to use in the painting.,0
"Use a piece of extra-fine sandpaper to remove any rough edges after cutting. Once this has been done, go to page 21 and cut out and color the four hieroglyphic strips.",0
"Begin by making the hull, then continue with the main deck, bi-pole mast, yardarm, and finally the throne platform—in that order.",0
See the scale drawing of the mast on page 21 for the correct size and placement of these structural crossbeams.,0
Secure them together with plastic modeling clamps. Allow these pieces to dry thoroughly.,0
Place the outlined papyrus or parchment paper on a clean sheet of unlined paper or on a clean cutting mat. Secure the edges of the sail material with thin strips of masking tape so the sail will not move during the painting and drying phase.,0
The hull is now ready for light sanding. Use a sheet of extra-fine sandpaper to gently smooth the hull’s sharp edges ONLY.,0
"The mast is a bi-pole, the style that was common 2,500 years before Christ.",0
"There is also a period floor design for the throne platform on page 21 (this is optional). Once all of these parts have been made, set them aside for assembly later.",0
The ancient Egyptians were the world’s first serious model makers. Their civilization spanned almost five thousand years.,0
This matches the boat’s curve and will allow for easy mounting later to the deck. Trace the canopy’s outline (see page 23) onto the balsa wood and carefully use an X-ACTO knife to cut it out.,0
The model’s mast is made of two pieces of ″ square wood strips that are slightly tapered at the top.,0
See the scale drawing of the mast on page 21 for the correct size and placement of these structural crossbeams. The bipole mast footing base is made from thick balsa wood measuring long x ″ wide.,0
"Use the curved deck as a reference when joining the sections together. The right side of the hull is built in the same manner as the left side: number 5 is glued to the boat’s keel. Next, glue number 6 to number 5, then glue number 7 to number 6, then, finally, glue number 8 to number 7. Next, glue the main deck to the top of the hull.",0
"The four strips are to be glued to each side of the platform, or you can make and color your own hieroglyphic markings. Page 23 shows exactly where to glue the completed throne platform to the main deck.",0
"It is best to use a thick sheet of balsa wood, because balsa can be easily curved when wet and it can hold that curve once it is dry. The canopy on page 19 shows that it has a slight fore and aft curve.",0
For most of that period they constructed wonderful models of things and places from everyday life out of wood and clay.,0
Cut out and color the period painting of Goddess Mut on page 20 and glue it to the top of the canopy using a light film of white carpenter’s glue (optional).,0
"Made of red cedar, it was very strong in order to support the heavy coarse linen sail.",0
"The hull should have a layered, or a stepped appearance. The pharaoh’s boat hull should not have a smooth look.",0
The four steering oars are to be mounted onto the boat’s stern with steering oar supports.,0
Use extra-fine sandpaper to lightly smooth the edges for a uniform appearance.,0
"Most impressive are their miniature models of farm scenes with cattle and sheep and the shops of carpenters, weavers, potters, butchers, and bakers.",0
Hold it in place until it bonds. Repeat this until you have attached all of the oar supports to the deck. The blades are made from thick balsa wood and each oar shaft is made of 0.005″ round brass rods that are 2¼″ long.,0
Make sure the loop is wide enough to hold each oar in place. The oar supports should be ¾″ long.,0
See page 20 for the shape of the blades. Apply a small drop of instant adhesive to the edge of the oar blade and carefully place the shaft onto the blade and hold until secure. Repeat this process until you have joined all of the oar blades to the oar shafts.,0
"Here you will see the shape of the ¼″ high wood stand, as well as the shape and appearance of the ancient pottery shard image.",0
(See page 23 for this pattern.) You will need to drill two holes in each support where indicated. The blades are made from thick balsa wood and each oar shaft is made of 0.008″ round brass rods that are 1 ″ long.,0
The base’s mounting post that supports the completed model is a 0.016″ round brass rod that is 2″ long.,0
Make five canopy support posts from 0.012″ round brass rods. Each post will be 1¼″ long.,0
"To attach the oar supports to the deck, place a small drop of instant adhesive to the straight side of the eyelet and insert it into the hole.",0
On page 22 you will find a full-scale pattern for the model’s display stand. You may also create your own design for the base if you choose.,0
"So, you cannot make a mistake as far as the final appearance of the boat is concerned. It is your project to have fun with, so go for it!",0
"To install the oar supports, use a medium-size sewing needle to make the holes ″ deep into the deck. Follow the scale drawing on page 20 for placement.",0
This special piece will be mounted on the stand later. You will need to drill a %″ hole into the stand where indicated.,0
The eight rowing oars are attached to the main deck with eyelets. To make the eyelets carefully bend a 0.006″ round brass rod into a small loop using needle-nose pliers.,0
"First, apply a coat of clear wood sealer to all wood parts, including the hull, to get a uniform application of the wood stain when it is applied later.",0
A scale drawing of the model’s display stand and a copy of a 2500 B.C. pottery shard unique to the period of King Khufu can be found on page 22.,0
The natural color of these boats would have appeared a light brown or a slightly reddish brown depending on the age and dryness of the cedar before construction.,0
Using your imagination to create new ideas is what makes scratch building models such a great and interesting lifetime hobby.,0
"The next step is the staining and hand painting of the previously constructed model parts, prior to their addition to the model’s hull.",0
The large Nile River boats during the time of King Khufu were mainly built of durable red cedar from the land that is now Lebanon.,0
Use white carpenter’s glue for securing wood to wood and use instant adhesive to bond wood to metal or metal to metal.,0
"If you choose to use the book’s pattern, it is best to use a hardwood such as walnut or pear. This is because these woods have a beautiful color tone when sanded lightly and sealed with a quality satin varnish.",0
"To reproduce the color designs you can make them yourself using extra-fine point felt-tip pens. The colors you will need are green, red, and brown. Or, you can easily cut out these decorative accents located on the inside covers. It will be your choice. Apply a light coat of clear water-based satin varnish to the paper to protect the designs and to give it an aged appearance.",0
The four steering oar blades and the eight rowing oar blades are painted tan.,0
"If balsa wood was used to construct the model, then staining the hull and other wood parts will be necessary to achieve the correct color tone.",0
"When the sealer is dry, use a light reddish brown stain on the hull and all other pre-finished wood parts. When the stain is dry, wipe off any excess stain with a clean paper towel before continuing.",0
"The ancient Egyptians also used cedar to make the boat’s mast, the yards for the sail, and the canopy. Therefore, these important pieces would also have the same color appearance as the hull.",0
Now that you have built all the parts for the model the next step is gluing them to the hull.,0
See pages 19 and 20 for blade decoration ideas. (NOTE: These decorations are optional.) Once all the model parts have been painted or stained set them aside. The model’s display stand is the next item for construction.,0
"If the model was constructed using a naturally dark wood such as mahogany, walnut, or pecan, then sealing and staining is not necessary as these woods already come very close to the correct color tone.",0
See page 22 for the placement of the brass support to properly balance the completed model.,0
It is an interesting fact that archaeologists don’t all agree on how a particular pharaoh’s sailing boat would have appeared in real life since to date none have been discovered intact.,0
"Glue the footing into place, using white carpenter’s glue, and let dry. Then place a drop of glue on both pieces of the mast’s bottom and mount the mast onto the footing. Hold it steady for a moment until the glue bonds.",0
Make sure the model is level and hold it secure until the glue firmly holds. Glue the pottery shard image to a ″ thick piece of balsa wood and attach to the display stand (optional).,0
"A first-time modeler should find these directions fun and easy to follow. However, if you do experience problems at any point during the construction, the important thing to remember is not to become discouraged.",0
Do this for both top corners of the sail. The other ends are then attached to the model by wrapping them around the left and right canopy posts and securing them with instant adhesive. Cut off any excess string.,0
The painting of the four steering oars and eight rowing oars are next. Paint the shafts of the oars medium red.,0
Queen Hatshepsut reigned from approximately 1479 to 1458 B.C. and was the first great woman in recorded history.,0
"Just as the ancient model builders put their own artistic identity into their boats, so, too, will the modern boat builder bring their own unique artistic expression to the project.",0
Congratulations! Your model is now built and ready to display.,0
BI-POLE MAST: Refer to page 20 for the location of the bi-pole mast footing on the main deck.,0
"During her years in power, the Egyptian economy flourished and expanded through trade relations with neighboring countries.",0
She was a pharaoh who created building projects that were grander and more numerous than any of her New Kingdom predecessors.,0
"Ship modeling in general, and building ancient Egyptian royal boats in particular, is a very subjective artistic project.",0
SECURING THE ROPE RIGGING: Cut two pieces of white cotton string 3″ long. Apply a drop of white carpenter’s glue to the end of the string and place it against a top corner of the sail and allow it to dry thoroughly.,0
Woods like sycamore from Nubia (what is now Sudan) and sturdy cedar imported from Lebanon were used to build the hull and mast.,0
The sail’s 6″ side will be the length; the sail’s 5″ side will be the width. It is recommended that you cut out an extra piece to use as a practice piece for the painting of the sail.,0
"Using the diagrams as a guide (pages 19 and 20), glue the following parts to the hull in this order. Allow all parts to dry before continuing to the next piece.",0
"Once the outline has been traced, gently retrace the pharaoh’s image using a medium brown, extra-fine point, felt-tip pen so all the lines and hieroglyphics will stand out for the painting phase.",0
She was the fifth pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty of ancient Egypt.,0
"The shipbuilding technology of Egypt was very advanced during this time. Queen Hatshepsut’s royal sailing boat was most likely state of the art in 1467 B.C., and constructed of the strongest woods available to shipwrights.",0
"Using these materials, Hatshepsut’s boat was so well built and sturdy it didn’t require the usual hogging ropes to support the vessel.",0
THRONE PLATFORM: Spread a thin film of white carpenter’s glue on the platform’s underside and secure it to the main deck and let it dry. See page 23 for the location of the throne platform on the main deck.,0
During her reign many pieces of statuary were produced. These pieces can be found in almost every major museum in the world,0
Use a ″ drill to make one hole ¼″ deep in the hull’s bottom where the dent appears. Place a drop of instant adhesive in the hole and insert the support rod into the hole.,0
"Take a 7¾″ x 11¾″ sheet of light colored papyrus or a sheet of beige parchment paper and, using an X-ACTO knife, carefully cut out a 6″ x 5″ piece from the blank sheet.",0
"Queen Hatshepsut is regarded by Egyptologists as one of the most successful pharaohs, ruling longer than any female leader other than Cleopatra VII.",0
"From their own land bordering the Nile River, shipwrights probably used the hardwood heart of the acacia tree to make the internal framing and supports very strong.",0
"Each boat has two pattern pages. Remove these pages from the book, and then glue them onto card stock. Carefully cut out the patterns using an XACTO knife. Having the patterns on card stock will make them easier to handle when tracing the patterns onto the wood. Each of the patterns has an initial on them for easy identification: K is for King Khufu’s boat, H is for Queen Hatshepsut’s boat, and R is for King Ramses II’s boat.",0
"By making Egypt rich and powerful, Queen Hatshepsut brought about a Golden Age for art and technology that was to last long after her death.",0
Secure the edges of the sail material with thin strips of masking tape so the sail will not move during the painting and drying phase.,0
"The paints are water-based acrylic and can be easily removed with water. For best results use small bristle camel’s hair brushes: very fine, fine, ″, and ¼″.",0
Place the 6″ x 5″ sheet squarely over the outline guide on page 31. Use a #2 pencil to gently trace the image onto the sail material.,0
The varnish will protect the paint and sail material from being damaged while handling and mounting the sail to the model’s yardarm and mast.,0
"SUPPORTS FOR THE EIGHT ROWING OARS: The drawing on page 20 shows the location of the supports. Drill eight holes, ″ deep into the main deck. Then place a small drop of instant adhesive over each hole and insert the oar support eyelets into place.",0
Place the outlined papyrus or parchment paper on a clean sheet of unlined paper or on a clean cutting mat.,0
ROYAL SAIL: Apply a thin bead of white carpenter’s glue along the leading edge of the yardarm. Then carefully place the top edge of the sail against the yardarm. Allow one hour to dry before continuing.,0
"The image may appear light now, but once it is placed under a good light source the lines will be easily seen for the final tracing before the actual painting of the sail.",0
"Begin making the hull, then continue with the main deck, mast, the yardarm, and finally the throne platform—in that order.",0
Refer to the painting instructions on page 31 and the color photograph of the completed sail located on the inside back cover as a guide for what colors to use in the painting.,0
"Next, trace and cut out the main deck piece on page 45. Glue the deck piece to the top of the hull. Secure them together with plastic modeling clamps (see photo on page 33).",0
"BRASS CANOPY SUPPORT POSTS: Drill five holes, ″ deep into the main deck as shown on page 19. Apply a small drop of instant adhesive on each post bottom and insert the posts into the holes.",0
The sail is now ready for mounting. Place the sail to the side for now while the next phase of construction begins.,0
"The paints are water-based acrylic and can be easily removed with water. For best results use small bristle camel’s hair brushes: very fine, fine, ″, and ¼″.",0
MOUNTING THE MODEL TO THE DISPLAY STAND: Place the bottom of the hull squarely over the base’s support rod and gently press the model down with enough pressure to cause a dent to appear in the hull’s bottom.,0
The wood should be a thick sheet. Carefully use an X-ACTO knife to cut the patterns out.,0
YARDARM: Refer to page 21 for the exact location of the yardarm on the mast and then attach it to the mast with white carpenter’s glue. Make sure that it is centered on the mast and you use enough glue so it bonds tight.,0
". If mistakes are made here in this process, use the spare sail material to start over again.",0
"Begin by painting the outlines carefully with short, steady strokes using the ″ brush with just a small amount of paint each time. Use a paper towel to clean off any excess paint from the brush.",0
"Once you are satisfied that all the details on the pharaoh’s portrait and hieroglyphic writing are complete, allow the paint to dry for two hours before applying a light coat of clear water-based satin varnish to both sides of the sail.",0
"All of the patterns are labeled for you on pages 43 and 45. Trace the patterns onto whatever wood you want: balsa, mahogany, walnut, etc.",0
"Refer to the patterns on pages 43 and 45, and the drawings on pages 39, 40, and 41 before starting this portion of the project.",0
"PLACING EIGHT ROWING OARS INTO THE SUPPORTS: Insert the eight oars into the eyelet supports. Using instant adhesive, glue each oar to its support ensuring the oar is bonded well before continuing on. All eight oars should line up together when you have completed this section.",0
The hull is made sandwich style. (See the drawing on page 39 as a guide.) Starting with the right side of the main keel (using white carpenter’s glue): glue piece 1R to the main keel at the top.,0
Allow these pieces to dry thoroughly. The hull is now ready for light sanding. Use a sheet of extra-fine sandpaper to gently smooth the hull’s sharp edges ONLY.,0
"Once the outlines are painted, allow them to dry thoroughly before using the very fine and fine brushes to paint the small details like the facial features and costumes.",0
"The left side of the hull is built in the same manner as the left side: piece 1L is glued to the main keel. Next, glue piece 2L to 1L, then, finally, glue piece 3L to 2L.",0
"Begin by painting the outlines carefully with short, steady strokes using the ″ brush with just a small amount of paint each time. Use a paper towel to clean off any excess paint from the brush.",0
CANOPY: Apply a drop of instant adhesive to the top of each support post and then lay the canopy piece directly on the posts. Make sure the canopy is straight and square on the posts. Press the canopy down gently against the posts for a few moments until the glue holds.,0
"Next, glue piece 2R to 1R, then glue piece 3R to 2R. Use the curved deck as a reference when joining the sections together. The right side of the hull is done.",0
"Once the outlines are painted, allow them to dry thoroughly before using the very fine and fine brushes to paint the small details like the facial features and costumes.",0
MOUNTING THE MODEL TO THE DISPLAY STAND: Place the bottom of the hull squarely over the base’s support rod and gently press the model down with enough pressure to cause a dent to appear in the hull’s bottom. Use a ″ drill to make one hole ¼″ deep in the hull’s bottom where the dent appears. Place a drop of instant adhesive in the hole and insert the support rod into the hole. Make sure the model is level and hold it secure until the glue firmly holds. Glue the pottery shard image to a ″ thick piece of balsa wood and attach to the display stand (optional).,0
"Once you are satisfied that all the details on the pharaoh’s portrait and the hieroglyphic writing are complete, allow the paint to dry for two hours before applying a light coat of clear water-based satin varnish to both sides of the sail.",0
"The hull should have a layered, or a stepped appearance. The pharaoh’s boat hull should not have a smooth look.",0
The sail is now ready for mounting. Place the sail to the side for now while the next phase of construction begins.,0
Refer to the painting instructions on page 51 and the color photograph of the completed sail located on the inside back cover as a guide for what colors to use in the painting.,0
"Refer to the patterns on pages 59 and 61, and the drawings on pages 56 and 57 before starting this portion of the project.",0
FOUR STEERING OARS: See the drawing on page 19 for the positioning of these oars. Insert the oars into the previously drilled holes in the supports and secure each oar with a small drop of instant adhesive. Hold each oar steady until the glue holds.,0
"Begin making the hull, then continue with the main deck, mast, yardarm, rowing and steering oars, oar supports, both cabin cupolas, the prow guards, and, finally, the display stand.",0
The varnish will protect the paint and sail material from being damaged while handling and mounting the sail to the model’s yardarm and mast.,0
SECURING THE ROPE RIGGING: See page 27 for the placement of the rigging rope on the sail. Cut two pieces of white cotton string 10″ long and attach one end to the corner of the sail’s bottom edge. Apply a drop of white carpenter’s glue to the end of the string and place it against a corner of the sail and allow it to dry thoroughly. Do this for both corners of the sail. The other end is then attached to the model by wrapping it around the last rowing oar support and gluing it with instant adhesive. Cut of any excess string.,0
"All of the patterns are labeled for you on pages 59 and 61. Trace the patterns onto whatever wood you want: balsa, mahogany, etc. The wood should be a thick sheet.",0
Two STEERING OARS: Refer to the drawing of the steering oars on page 41 for the positioning of these oars. Insert the oars into the previously drilled holes and secure each oar with a drop of instant adhesive. Hold each oar steady until the glue holds.,0
"Carefully use an X-ACTO knife to cut the patterns out. The hull is made sandwich style. (See the drawing on page 56 as a guide.) Starting with the left side of the boat’s keel: glue number 1 to the boat’s keel at the top, Next, glue number 2 to number 1, then, finally, glue number 3 to number 2.",0
"Egyptologists believe it was Ramses II who was the pharaoh during the Jewish exodus from Egypt. His long active reign did cover that historic period in time. Ramses II lived during the time referred to as the Age of Classical Antiquity. He was a builder of cities and raised the standard of living for his subjects. He made Egypt a wealthy and powerful land whose influence spread from what is now called Sudan, Palestine, and Syria. Upon his death he was buried in the Valley of the Kings where, in 1881, his mummy was discovered in a simple grave. Today his remains are kept at the Cairo Museum.",0
"The right side of the hull is built in the same manner as the left side: number 1 is glued to the boat’s keel. Next, glue the number 2 to number 1, then, finally, glue number 3 to number 2.",0
The hull is now ready for light sanding. Use a sheet of extra-fine sandpaper to gently smooth the hull’s sharp edges ONLY.,0
CANOPY: Place a drop of instant adhesive to the top of each support post and then lay the canopy piece directly on the posts. Make sure the canopy is straight and square on the posts. Press the canopy down gently against the posts for a few moments until the glue holds.,0
Construct the mast and yardarm from the patterns shown on page 59. Use an ″ round dowel for the mast and round dowel for the yardarm. Use extra-fine sandpaper to shape the mast.,0
"Allow these pieces to dry thoroughly. Next, glue the main deck to the top of the hull. Secure them together with plastic modeling clamps.",0
"The word pharaoh is not Egyptian in origin, but comes from the ancient Hebrew word for “leader.” If ever a pharaoh epitomized that title it was Ramses II, an Egyptian king of the 19th Dynasty who reigned from 1279 to 1213 B.C. Greatly respected by his people and enemies alike, he was given the title “Ramses the Great″ in his own lifetime.",0
"Place the 4″ x 3″ sheet squarely over the outline guide on page 51. Use a #2 pencil to gently trace the image onto the sail material. The image may appear light now, but once it is placed under a good light source the lines will be easily seen for the final tracing before the actual painting of the sail.",0
The next part of the project involves making the two large steering oars that will mount at the rear of the boat and the ten rowing oars (see photo on page 53).,0
YARDARM: Refer to page 41 for the exact location of the yardarm on the mast and then attach it to the mast with white carpenter’s glue. Make sure that it is centered on the mast and you use enough glue so it bonds tight.,0
"The hull should have a layered, or a stepped appearance. The pharaoh’s boat hull should not have a smooth look.",0
Use the curved deck as a reference when joining the sections together. The left side of the hull is done.,0
The rowing oars blades are made from thick balsa wood with 0.010″ round brass rods for the shafts. The two steering oar supports are on page 59.,0
ROYAL SAIL: Apply a thin bead of white carpenter’s glue along the leading edge of the yardarm. Then carefully place the top edge of the sail against the yardarm. Allow one hour to dry before continuing.,0
"When the supports are completed, see page 57 for where to glue the port and starboard support.",0
Allow these small and delicate parts to dry thoroughly. The four posts supporting the cabin top are made from round dowels.,0
"Take a 7¾″ x 11¾″ sheet of light colored papyrus or a sheet of beige parchment paper and, using an X-ACTO knife, carefully cut out a 4″ x 3″ piece from the blank sheet. The sail’s 4″ side will be the length; the sail’s 3″ side will be the width. It is recommended that you cut out an extra piece to use as a practice piece for the painting of the sail.",0
"(NOTE: These highly decorated cabin cupolas during the reign of Ramses II were strictly reserved for royalty.) Make two complete cabin cupolas. Also, notice on page 56 that the cabins face each other on the main deck.",0
Place the outlined papyrus or parchment paper on a clean sheet of unlined paper or on a clean cutting mat. Secure the edges of the sail material with thin strips of masking tape so the sail will not move during the painting and drying phase.,0
"Refer to page 56 for the size of the two front and two rear posts. Glue the posts into position and when dry, trace the cabin top pattern on page 59 onto a sheet of balsa wood.",0
"The two cabin cupolas are built from the same pattern found on page 59. On that page there are five pieces for the cupola (top, base, rear, and two sides).",0
"As for the shipbuilding technology during this time, Ramses II built the largest warships for his navy than any of the previous rulers of Egypt. Today, the Cairo Museum has an impressive display of Ramses II’s warships on exhibition. These wonderful models of the vessels in his once magnificent navy are on display only a few steps away from where Ramses II’s mummy rests.",0
"The pattern for the two prow pieces is shown on page 59. Use thick balsa wood to make these pieces. The ancient Egyptian mariners considered the “Eye of Horus,” a symbol of good luck.",0
Trace their patterns onto a thick sheet of basswood and carefully cut them out. Mark the holes where the steering oars will be inserted and drill a 0.020″ hole into each support.,0
Refer to page 57 for these patterns. The steering oar blades are made from thick balsa wood. The shafts are 0.020″ round brass rods.,0
"Trace the patterns for the base, rear, and two sides onto a thick sheet of basswood then cut out the pieces. Begin building the cupola by gluing the rear and two sides to the base.",0
"Once the outline has been traced, gently retrace the pharaoh’s image using a medium brown, extra-fine point, felt-tip pen so all the lines and hieroglyphs will stand out for the painting phase. If mistakes are made here in this process, use the spare sail material to start over again.",0
"The ancient Egyptians also used white cedar to make the mast, yardarm, cabins, and oars. Therefore, it can be assumed that the color of these pieces would also have match the color of the hull.",0
Constructing the display stand is next. Take a piece of ¼″ thick red oak and using the display stand pattern on page 58 trace that pattern onto the oak piece. Cut out the piece using a coping saw.,0
". First, apply a coat of clear wood sealer to all wood parts, including the hull, to get a uniform application of the wood stain when it is applied later.",0
"Bend the canopy piece and let it dry. Then glue it to the four posts. See page 56 for hieroglyphic symbols to be cut out, colored, and applied to the sides of the cupolas, and page 57 for a period painting for the cupola’s top.",0
Blondie Hasler died after completion of the present work but before its publication. The name Hasler is readily associated with a number of marine projects of which perhaps the most significant was the development of wind vane steering for yachts.,0
A large Nile River boat during the reign of King Ramses II was built of white cedar and acacia wood. The natural color of these boats would have appeared a light oak color.,0
"Sail enthusiasts all over the world are showing an increasing interest in the Chinese, or 'junk', rig. This is because the rig is incomparably safe, seamanlike, and easy to handle.",0
"Blondie was of course responsible for the first singlehanded transatlantic race in I960, and shortly before it he altered the rig of his modified folkboat Jester from the experimental Lapwing to a single Chinese lugsail slung on an unstayed mast. The boat has used the same rig ever since on her many long voyages, which include thirteen transatlantic passages.",0
Cut out the cabin top piece and soak it in warm water for a minute so it can be bent slightly to match the curve of the canopy on page 56.,0
"The authors' qualifications are simply that we have worked together on the development of the Chinese rig for 25 years, using it on our own boats and designing rigs for other yachtsmen in various parts of the world.",0
The color tone would have varied from vessel to vessel depending on the wood’s age and dryness before construction.,0
"However, it may be that his most enduring contribution will be seen to be the adaptation of the principles underlying the traditional Chinese rig to western sailing craft. He devoted his last twenty years to it.",0
"Once this is done, sandpaper the oval shape smooth and seal the base with water-based satin varnish. The base’s mounting post that supports the completed model is a 0.030″ round brass rod that is 2″ long.",0
"This book is intended to provide a primer for those who want to study the rig in detail. It describes the process of designing a rig for any specific boat, rigging it, and sailing it. It is written equally for the amateur owner and for the professional designer who may be approaching the subject for the first time.",0
The platform where the mast and sail are mounted is made from a ″ thick piece of balsa wood 2″ long x ¾″ wide. The stairs leading up to the platform are made of ″ thick balsa wood. See page 59 for these patterns.,0
"When the sealer is dry, use a light oak stain on the hull and all other pre-finished wood parts. When the stain is dry, wipe off any excess stain with a clean paper towel before continuing.",0
"If balsa wood was used to construct the model, then staining the hull and other wood parts will be necessary to achieve the correct color tone.",0
"Our most distinguished client is undoubtedly Bill King, whose 42 ft (12.8m) Galway Blazer II (pg 215 and Fig 16.3) carried him across 40,000 miles of ocean singlehanded before he sold her to Peter Crowther for further voyaging. We believe that she may have been the first junk-rigged vessel in history to have sailed round the world or round the Horn.",0
"Draw these patterns onto your prow pieces using an extra-fine point, felt-tip pen. Once all these parts have been completed, set them aside for assembly later.",0
"MAST: Begin by drilling a ″ hole, ¼″ deep into the main deck for the mast. See page 56 for the location of the mast. Place a drop of white carpenter’s glue on the mast bottom and insert the mast into the hole and allow it to dry.",0
"TEN ROWING OAR SUPPORTS: Refer to page 47 for the location of the ten rowing oar supports (5 on each side). Drill ten holes, ″ deep into the main deck. Place a small drop of instant adhesive into the hole and insert the oar support. Keep each support even with respect to the other supports.",0
Place a drop of instant adhesive in the hole and insert the support rod into the hole. Make sure the model is level and hold it secure until the glue firmly holds. Glue the pottery shard image to a ″ thick piece of balsa wood and attach to the display stand (optional).,0
"We are not experts on the vessels of the China coast, nor in the history of the rig, but hope that some of the references in the Bibliography will help readers whose interest lies in that direction. Inevitably this list is incomplete, as is our knowledge of the work done by other Western designers.",0
Now that you have built all the parts for the model the next step is gluing them to the hull. Use white carpenter’s glue for securing wood to wood and use instant adhesive to bond wood to metal or metal to metal.,0
"The adaptation of this ancient rig to modern needs is still in an early stage, but we have tried to provide a starting point from which other enthusiasts will make further headway.",0
PHARAOH’S PLATFORM: Refer to page 57 for the platform’s location on the main deck. Spread a thin coat of white carpenter’s glue on the platform bottom and secure it to the main deck.,0
"The most important of these is Michael Richey, the present owner of Jester and the editor of a number of publications. His ability as an author and his experience and knowledge of publishing with his helpful criticism and advice have been invaluable to us.",0
"If the model was constructed using a slightly darker wood like pecan or light walnut, then sealing and staining is not necessary as these woods already come close to the correct tone for this boat.",0
"We would also like to include Peter Lucas of W G Lucas and Son, sailmakers; R Mason of R Mason and Son, the patentees of the 'Noble Mast' system; and David Hunt of Needlespar Ltd, Warsash; for their specialist advice and comments.",0
CABIN CUPOLAS: Both cupolas are glued to the main deck. See page 56 for the location of the cupolas. (NOTE: The open sections of the cupolas face each other.) Only a small amount of white carpenter’s glue is needed to secure the cupola to the deck. Allow at least 45 minutes for these pieces to dry.,0
"Between us we have sailed at least 65,000 miles of open sea with it, including ten crossings of the North Atlantic. The more we sail with it the more we like it, and this is true both on ocean passages and when cruising in coastal waters.",0
The painting of the ten rowing oars and the two large steering oars is next. The shafts are painted dark green and the blade portion of each oar is painted white. See page 57 for oar blade decorations (optional).,0
"Press one corner of the string onto the glue and allow it to dry. When dry, the free end of each string is wrapped around the last rowing oar post and secured using instant adhesive.",0
"Using the diagrams as a guide (pages 56 and 57), glue the following parts to the hull in this order. Allow all parts to dry before continuing to the next piece.",0
We would like to take this opportunity to express our thanks to those who have provided advice and information from their own experiences or specialist knowledge.,0
MOUNTING THE MODEL TO THE DISPLAY STAND: Place the bottom of the hull squarely over the base’s support rod and gently press the model down with enough pressure to cause a dent to appear in the hull’s bottom. Use a ″ drill to make one hole ¼″ deep in the hull’s bottom where the dent appears.,0
YARDARM: Center the yardarm at the top of the mast and use a drop or two of white carpenter’s glue to secure it to the main mast. Allow a few minutes for the glue to set so it bonds tight.,0
SECURING THE STRING RIGGING TO THE SAIL AND MODEL: Refer to page 47 for the placement of the sail ropes and where to secure them. Cut two pieces of string 8″ long for the sail’s rigging. Place a drop of white carpenter’s glue on the bottom corners of the sail.,0
"We also wish to thank Rear Admiral R L Fisher, the original owner of Yeong, Commander Bill King (Galway Blazer II), and Timothy Dunn of Batwing, for permission to use drawings and to mention their experiences.",0
Neither is there any work on the geometry and aerodynamic theory that lie behind them. Practical Junk Rig admirably fills that need. It is both a handbook for the mariner and a work of reference for anyone who wants to study in detail this most appealing and seamanlike of rigs.,0
MOUNTING THE Two LARGE STEERING OARS: See the drawing on page 56 for the positioning of these oars. Secure each oar to its support hole with a drop of instant adhesive and allow time for them to dry completely.,0
"There are also other friends and acquaintances who have helped, encouraged or stimulated thought, and we extend our thanks to them too.",0
"It is very pleasing to be able to say that this has certainly occurred, and that not only is the junk rig in use all over the world with designs produced from the advice in our book, but it is also used by enthusiasts who have developed their own ideas by experiment and trial.",0
"With his co-author Jock McLeod Blondie designed junk rigs for a number of vessels and, in addition to their own considerable experience, was able to profit by the seagoing experience of others such as Bill King whose junk-rigged Galway Blazer II completed a circumnavigation in 1973. This book is the result of all that work. But it is more.",0
In our original Preface we stated that the adaptation of this rig to modern needs was still in an early stage but that we hoped our book would provide a starting point from which other enthusiasts would make further headway,0
ROYAL SAIL: Place a thin bead of white glue across the top part of the sail yardarm. Then carefully place the top of the sail flat against the yardarm and allow time to dry completely before continuing.,0
One case in point was our decision to have all the battens in one sail the same length.,0
"There appears to be no comprehensive Chinese text on the rig and although a number of Western sources describe in detail the rigging of contemporary Chinese vessels, there is nothing that tells you how to design junk rigs or how to sail them.",0
This can entail some complication and expense in manufacture but has produced results that please the designers who claim that it improves the closewindedness of their rig.,0
By 1430 the seagoing junks of the Ming dynasty seem to have been substantially larger than any ships of the Western world and to have voyaged in huge fleets at least as far as the Red Sea and East Africa.,0
"PLACING TEN ROWING OARS INTO THE SUPPORTS: Insert the ten oars into the eyelet supports. Using instant adhesive, glue each oar to its support ensuring the oar is bonded well before continuing on. All ten oars should line up together when you have completed this section.",0
"The junk rig is not a square rig but was one of the earliest of the true fore-and-aft rigs, that is to say rigs in which the wind blows against opposite sides of the sail on opposite tacks.",0
"The great junks of this time may have reached 500 ft (152 m) in overall length, which is far larger than any seen since and nearly twice as long as the Cutty Sark, but by the 16th century the Ming navy had all but vanished, a victim of political change.",0
The windward ability of Western rigs has been transformed in fairly recent times by the development of high-quality sailcloth and sophisticated sailmaking.,0
"The junk sail can be made to set very flat in all wind strengths regardless of whether it is made of good sailcloth, bamboo matting, or indeed old flour sacks.",0
"This restricts the almost infinite choice of sail shape as used by the Chinese and some modern designers, but it enables users to carry a few spare battens that will fit in any panel of the sail without modification; a very important consideration when faced with replacing a batten in wild weather and seas.",0
"Its worst point of sailing is ghosting to windward in a lop or swell. Off the wind, the sail is excellent for its area in all wind strengths.",0
"Further experiments have also been carried out with articulated battens that can produce a more aerodynamic shaped sail, closer to the curvature of a bermudian sail.",0
"It is probably true to say that most of these successful developments have produced slightly more complication into the rig to achieve the result that the experimenters required. Blondie Hasler and I were at pains to keep our design as simple as possible, and in some aspects this restricted us, but that was our choice.",0
"Comparisons between rigs are difficult to make, particularly when mounted on different hulls, but nowadays the windward performance of a good junk rig seems to be comparable with that of a gaff rig - perhaps less good in light airs but better in a blow. I",0
"There is no room in this reprint to cover all the new ideas that have developed since 1987 but there are some excellent sources of information for those who wish to consider alternative ideas to those in this book, which is really a primer on the subject to provide a sound starting point.",0
"The first Chinese lugsails, made of matting woven from thin strips of bamboo and stiffened by bamboo or pine battens, are believed to have appeared in China before AD 300.",0
"However with the progress of new materials and design it can be argued that much stronger battens can be devised than those suggested by us, but probably at greater expense.",0
"This left only the smaller coasters and river traders that have continued to develop in design, but not in size, into the 20th century.",0
"For centuries it may have been the most efficient windward rig in the world, particularly in hard winds when the flat sail develops good drive while inducing minimum leeway.",0
"From Marco Polo onwards, Western observers on the China coast have become fascinated by junks in their endless variety of size and type, and have praised their efficiency as practical sailing craft while struggling to understand the thinking of Chinese shipwrights and sailors, which seemed so often to be the exact opposite of their own.",0
"Previously, all large Western sails tended to develop too much 'belly' for windward work, and seamen were continually trying to make them set flatter.",0
"There is no standard type of sail in China, and every conceivable variation seems to exist. Fig. 1.1 shows some of the sail shapes recorded there in the past fifty years.",0
"These include junks of 180 ft (55 m) in length with anything up to five masts, some of them over 6 ft (1.8 m) in diameter at the deck and carrying sails of over 3,000 sq ft (279m2 ).",0
"It will be seen that the number of battens, and hence the width of the sail panels, varies very considerably. It seems possible that the mat sails used in the past demanded narrow panels, a large number of battens, and square heads.",0
"The subdivision of the sail into a number of separate panels, each supported and controlled by its own system of sheets, battens, bolt ropes, and parrels, ensures that the stresses are shared between many load-carrying components and that no one part takes a heavy load except for the mast and halyard.",0
"The best source of information is the Junk Rig Association (JRA), which has members around the world, many of whom are active in development of the rig, and I am most grateful to the current Chairman and Secretary for kindly producing an update for this new edition (Appendix C) giving a brief account of the progress that many members have made after trial and experiment, and giving other sources of information and advice.",0
The rig can be used on boats of widely different sizes and functions. A dinghy of 8 ft (2.4 m) overall length has given good service as a yacht's tender with a simplified and portable junk sail of 49 sq ft (4.6 m2 ).,0
The upper limit of size is imposed by the fact that all halyard loads must be carried by the masthead and cannot be distributed lower down the mast.,0
"Even on the mast, the lateral loads are distributed along it by the battens and parrels and not concentrated at the masthead as they are with the dipping lugsail favoured by British fishing boats in the last days of sail.",0
An aesthetic attraction of the rig for many sailors lies in its use of seamanlike cordage and traditional fittings.,0
"The loads on sailcloth and sheets are vastly less than with the Western rig, and it is difficult to think of any other rig in which a huge seagoing sail could be made of bamboo matting and yet be able to sail through a gale without damage.",0
"The square-headed sail a seems to be the ancient shape and is still widely used, particularly on inland waters in the high-aspect-ratio form shown at b.",0
"Whereas with a normal Western rig traditional gear is less efficient than modern gear, with the junk rig it is more efficient and the traditionalist need make no excuses for using it.",0
The introduction of cotton sailcloth has probably contributed to the development of high-peaked sails with fewer battens and wider panels.,0
In many ways it is valid to think of the junk sail as being a number of much smaller sails joined together.,0
"The remaining sketches show forms in which the head is more steeply angled, that shown at f, which is the foresail of a three-master, having a head that is actually in line with the luff.",0
"All native Chinese rigs share a number of features. They are constructed of cheap and readily available materials, with very few metal parts.",0
"All the hauling ropes may be led to the steering position and there will be no need for the watchkeeper to move around the deck - a valuable safety feature in a small boat at sea, especially when a gale blows up in the middle of the night.",0
"An area of about 3,000 sq ft (279 m 2 ) for a single sail would seem to be near the practical limit.",0
Conventional spinnakers are not efficient for their area; they are just an efficient way of setting a lot more area.,0
At the other end of the scale it would clearly be possible to emulate the Chinese with junk-rigged cargo-carrying coasters.,0
"In demanding a fully-automatic sail the Western designer accepts more restrictions on the shape of the sail than his Chinese counterpart, but his work remains wholly based on 1,700 years of continuous development in China.",0
"The area of a junk sail may be kept constantly adjusted to changing conditions without imposing any real strain on the crew. It is not necessary to worry about what the weather is going to do, but only about what it is actually doing.",0
The considerations that affect the choice of rig are discussed on p 94.,0
"The word 'rig' is used for the whole assembly of sails, masts, spars, fittings and cordage as used on any one boat. Only one junk sail is carried on each mast, but the number of masts may be varied.",0
"The 'twist' of a sail is defined as the variation in its incidence to the wind, taken at different heights above the deck. The junk sail commonly shows little or no twist whereas Western rigs, particularly the gaff rig, often develop far too much twist in a hard breeze, with the foot sheeted too flat and the head sagging too far off.",0
By making the sail more controllable the junk rig is improving the capabilities of small cruising yachts and setting new standards for short-handed seamanship.,0
"The smaller the boat the more demanding the deck work in bad weather at sea, and the greater the advantage of the junk rig.",0
"It is convenient to establish Western names for the various different arrangements of the rig, and Fig. 1.3 shows the names adopted for this book.",0
Almost any squall can be ridden out in peace by letting go the sheet and lying a-hull. It is quite difficult for the sail to get itself into a real mess.,0
"So far the majority of Western rigs have been single-masted, and most of the rest have been two-masted schooners with the mainsail about twice the size of the foresail.",0
"Protection of this sort is seamanlike, since it eliminates the physical exposure that is one of the most potent sources of exhaustion.",0
"In any one rig the sails may be of different sizes and shapes, but each sail will be rigged in substantially the same way, as described in the following pages.",0
"The ends of all running ropes may be secured to the ship, and if you let go everything within sight the sail furls itself without smothering the deck in loose canvas.",0
"It is often convenient to use reefing as a way of 'easing the throttle', slowing down temporarily for reasons of comfort or safety, or for better control in narrow channels.",0
"InRon Glas (Fig. 16.4) the system of protection goes further, in that all running ropes are led inside the doghouse so that the whole rig can be handled without wearing oilskins.",0
"Now that you have built all the parts for the model the next step is gluing them to the hull. Use white carpenter’s glue for securing wood to wood and use instant adhesive to bond wood to metal or metal to metal. Using the diagrams as a guide (pages 39 and 40), glue the following parts to the hull in this order. Allow all parts to dry before continuing to the next piece.",0
Gybing is noticeably gentler than with a gaff or Bermudian sail.,0
"BRASS CANOPY SUPPORT POSTS: Drill four round holes, ″ deep into the main deck as shown on page 39. Use a small drop of instant adhesive on each post and insert the posts into the holes.",0
"When furled the sail remains ready for use, and never has to be unbent or stowed below.",0
"PLACING Six ROWING OARS INTO THE SUPPORTS: Insert the six oars into the eyelet supports. Using instant adhesive, glue each oar to its support ensuring the oar is bonded well before continuing on. All six oars should line up together when you have completed this section.",0
"The sail remains always on the same side of the mast, and when sailing is therefore sometimes to windward and sometimes to leeward of it.",0
"A few junk-rigged boats set lightweight unbattened ghosting sails in light airs, but these are not part of the working rig and will not be discussed until Chapter 5.",0
"This seems to cover all the variations likely to be used in the West, but anyone wishing to use four or more masts could extend the nomenclature for himself.",0
"MAST: Begin by drilling a ″ round hole, ¼″ deep into the main deck for the mast. See page 40 for the location of the mast. Apply a drop of white carpenter’s glue on the mast bottom and insert it into the hole. Hold it in place for a moment until the glue bonds.",0
The yard is hoisted by a halyard leading from the masthead.,0
"Unlike a conventional spinnaker, the junk sail will never induce rhythmic rolling on a run. A junk-rigged yacht of 50 ft (15 m) in length never demands more than a single watchkeeper for any sailing operation, including tacking, gybing, reefing, furling, and making sail.",0
"For fishing and workboats the rig is unrivalled, being docile and controllable when set but held well above the deck while reefing or when furled.",0
The junk sail may be described as a fully-battened balanced lugsail. Fig. 1.4 shows its essential features and the names of its parts.,0
"SUPPORTS FOR THE Six ROWING OARS: The drawing on page 45 shows the location of the supports. Drill six holes, ″ deep into the main deck. Then place a small drop of instant adhesive over each hole and insert the oar support eyelets into place.",0
The sail is spread between a yard and a boom and is stiffened by a number of full-length battens that divide the sail into panels.,0
Balance may also be measured in linear terms: e.g. a batten may have 10 per cent of its length forward of the mast.,0
THRONE PLATFORM: Spread a thin film of white carpenter’s glue on the platform’s underside and secure it to the main deck and let it dry. See page 40 for the location of the throne platform on the main deck.,0
"In this simple form of the sail, reefing is achieved by paying out the halyard until one or more of the lowest panels of the sail have stowed themselves in the topping-lifts.",0
"Although simple in concept, the geometry of the rig is fairly subtle, as discussed in Chapter 2, and imposes a number of limitations on the shape and battening of the sail if it is to reef and furl neatly.",0
"The battens are attached to the sail along most of their length as well as at either end, and are numbered upwards as shown.",0
"A proportion of the sail, varying between 5 and 30 per cent of its area, lies forward of the mast, and this percentage is known as the 'balance'.",0
See page 41 for blade decoration ideas. (NOTE: These decorations are optional.) The six oar supports (see eyelets on page 40) are painted flat black. Once all the model parts have been painted or stained set them aside for now. The model’s display stand is the next item for construction.,0
"The battens hold the sail stretched from luff to leech at all times so that it cannot thrash or flog when head to wind with a slack sheet, but will 'weathercock' quietly, even in a gale, by just swinging gently from side to side.",0
". It altogether inhibits the useful and safe operation of hulling with slack sheets, something that is second nature to the docile junk rig.",0
"If you choose to use the book’s pattern, it is best to use a hardwood such as oak or apple. This is because these woods have a beautiful color tone when sanded lightly and sealed with a quality satin varnish. See page 42 for the placement of the brass support to properly balance the completed model.",0
Narrow sail panels are the best insurance against an untidy bundle that flutters.,0
"Tacking and gybing are performed simply by steering the boat round on to the new course, without touching the sheets.",0
"The flogging of a soft sail is unnerving, noisy, and a quick way of wearing out sailcloth and stitching. In a conventional rig with a fresh breeze it happens every time you hoist sail, every time you tack, and every time you luff up to a mooring or a man overboard.",0
On page 42 you will find a full-scale pattern for the model’s display stand. You may also create your own design for the base if you choose. Using your imagination to create new ideas is what makes scratch building models such a great and interesting lifetime hobby.,0
As soon as the halyard is started the pressure on the sail is relieved because the sheet goes slack.,0
"When a Chinese sail becomes torn or lets go a seam, the damage remains localised and the repair may be postponed indefinitely.",0
"The hulls of many Chinese workboats have very little lateral resistance, and there is evidence that such hulls can get to windward better with the Chinese than with a Western rig. Joshua Slocum chose a three-masted junk rig for the 35 ft (11 m) canoe Liberdade which he built for himself after the wreck of the barque Aquidneck, and in which he and his family sailed 5,500 miles from Brazil to South Carolina in 1888, averaging 105 miles a day. He wrote: 'Her rig was the Chinese sampan style, which is, I consider, the most convenient boat rig in the whole world/",0
"Unlike other rigs, the junk sail wants to reef and furl itself, and will do so as soon as it is given the opportunity.",0
"Flapping is seldom experienced in the junk rig, and should be cured by a sailmaker. Fluttering may sometimes be found near the luff or leech, and also in the loose folds of cloth lying in the lifts when reefed or furled.",0
"The painting of the two oar supports, two steering oars, and six rowing oars are next. Paint the shafts and handles of the rowing oars dark red. The six rowing oar blades and the two steering oar blades are painted bright white.",0
"The Western observer, laughing at the sight of a junk with her sails full of holes, may overlook the fact that she is working briskly to windward through a crowded anchorage.",0
"The ancient Egyptians also used cedar to make the boat’s mast, yards for the sail, and the canopy. Therefore, these important pieces would also have the same color appearance as the hull.",0
"Here the main problems seem to be complexity of batten construction, lack of 'topsail' area for light going, and reluctance of the sail to furl itself neatly.",0
The requirements of Western seamen are different from those of the Chinese in a number of ways.,0
"The next step is the staining and hand painting of the previously constructed model parts, prior to their addition to model’s hull. If balsa wood was used to construct the model, then staining the hull and other wood parts will be necessary to achieve the correct color tone.",0
"It will be seen that the sheet spans hold the leech of the sail, including the furled part, down, and it is not normally necessary to pass any lashings, pendants, or reef points to hold it down.",0
"The mainsail of a large Chinese junk may weigh five tons, with a yard over 65 ft (20 m) long and two or more separate halyards. It can take the whole crew over an hour to hoist such a sail, but reefing and furling is a matter of seconds and the rig is almost squall-proof.",0
"In China, this sail has usually in the past been carried on an unstayed",0
"If the model was constructed using a naturally light colored wood like basswood or pear, then sealing and staining may not be necessary as these woods come very close to the correct color tone.",0
"Of these, group (a) is beyond the scope of this book. In group (b) many experimenters are still at work, mainly in the development of battened fabric aerofoils embracing the mast.",0
"None of these 'improvements' has yet proved superior to the standard junk sail for serious ocean cruising, whether up or down wind.",0
"The aerodynamicist may argue that a certain amount of twist is needed for efficiency when close-hauled with a tall sail, because the wind velocity increases with height.",0
"First, apply a coat of clear wood sealer to all wood parts, including the hull, to get a uniform application of the wood stain when it is applied later. When the sealer is dry, use a light oak stain on the hull and all other pre-finished wood parts. When the stain is dry, wipe off any excess stain with a clean paper towel before continuing.",0
"Such a mast stands up like a tree and bends like a tree under load, being stepped on the keelson and supported at the partners.",0
After the halyard is belayed the slack sheet is taken in until the sail is correctly trimmed. Fig. 1.5 shows the same sail reefed down to two panels.,0
"In this role the apparent complexity of gear can be more than offset by its freedom from flogging, its self-stowing facility, and the possibility of handling all running ropes from inside the wheelhouse.",0
"For example, the Scottish Fifies and Zulus carried their huge dipping lugs, sometimes of 1,600 sq ft (149 m2 ), on masts that were innocent of any standing rigging.",0
"Many Western yachtsmen now want to make long open-sea passages in very small boats, an ambition that has never been evident in China. Many also want to sail singlehanded, or with a weak crew of family or friends that may not include any other competent seamen.",0
If the remainder of the halyard is paid out the sail will furl itself into the lifts and the sheets may be set up to hold the furled bundle fore-and-aft.,0
"There should be nothing in this to alarm the Western seaman, since many sizeable working vessels on both sides of the Atlantic were rigged with unstayed masts in the days of sail.",0
"In general, we are dealing with fully-rigged sailing vessels, i.e. vessels in which sail provides the main means of propulsion or has at least an equal importance with the power unit, but the junk sail has also proved effective as an auxiliary sail for fully-powered vessels.",0
"Many Chinese and some Western variations interpose adjustable spans (not shown) between sheet and sheet spans, and we call these 'sheet hauling spans'.",0
"Commercial sail is almost extinct, or at least dormant, in the West, and the demand so far has been for yachts.",0
"The forward end of the bundle is supported by a 'mast lift' that leads from the masthead down the outside of the sail and finishes in a loose loop around the mast, holding the bundle in against the mast.",0
"Normal single sheets are shown, in which a single system is attached to the leech and controls the sail on either tack.",0
"In recent years some Chinese vessels have fitted shrouds to the masthead, perhaps in imitation of Western practice, and some Western users of the junk rig have done likewise.",0
"One such user also found that the inertia effect of the cantilever mast slowed down the boat's period of roll, even with no sail set, to such an extent that he was able to remove his bilge keels and thereby get an extra half-knot under power.",0
"A system of topping-lifts, or lazy-jacks, leads from the masthead down one side of the sail and passes through eyes on the underside of the boom to a similar system on the other side of the sail.",0
"An unstayed mast naturally needs to be strongly connected to the hull at the partners and step, but the stresses transmitted to the hull are much lighter than those imposed by standing rigging, and much less likely to strain the hull.",0
"In this book we concentrate on group (c), in which the recommended rigs have already proved themselves to be fully seaworthy and widely acceptable.",0
On a run or broad reach the sail chafes against them.,0
"We use the word 'sheet' for the running part, and 'sheet spans' for the standing parts attached to the battens.",0
"Making sail, or shaking out reefs, is done by letting go the sheet, preferably until the sail is weathercocking, then hoisting on the halyard until the required amount of sail is spread. The slack of the sheet may then be taken in to trim the sail.",0
When on a broad reach or run the sheets are paid out until the sail is square to the boat.,0
Each batten is held close to the mast by a batten parrel which permits it to slide freely up or down the mast.,0
"Junk sails may be designed to lie either on the port or starboard side of the mast, and both may be found in China, with some multi-masted junks setting some of their sails on one side and some on the other.",0
"Sheet hauling spans are often used, and have to be readjusted when reefing or furling. The first reef is often taken upwards, by heaving in on the topping-lifts. By accepting this kind of deck work the Chinese are able to use a wide variety of sail shapes and layouts.",0
"Various secondary ropes, commonly used, are not shown here but will be described in Chapters 2 and 3.",0
"These lifts are slack when under full sail, but as soon as the sail is lowered for reefing or furling they automatically go taut and gather the furled panels into a bundle.",0
"There is no clear-cut difference in efficiency between sailing with the sail to windward or to leeward of the mast, and different users form different opinions.",0
"The sail is sheeted by a system of ropes that pull on the after ends of all, or nearly all, the battens.",0
"As developed in Britain, the rig is fully automatic in that all sail handling is done simply by veering or hauling ropes from a single position, and without ever touching the sail itself.",0
"Since it is impossible to use lower shrouds, or to fit effective spreaders, the angle between shroud and mast is nearly always too small, giving poor lateral support, heavy shroud tensions, and severe compression loads that may actually break the mast instead of supporting it. It is considered that 15° is the minimum permissible angle between a masthead shroud and the mast, and this can seldom be achieved without spreaders on a monohulled boat, although possible with a multi-hull.",0
"This is of course quite different from the soft Western lug, which performs much better when to leeward of the mast. The battens of a junk sail lie between the sail and the mast, and tend to hold the sail off the mast when on the windward side.",0
The sail cannot be squared fully off at right angles to the hull. Weathercocking is restricted and running becomes less efficient and more prone to accidental gybes.,0
The lower sheet block sometimes has a rope tail that is belayed to the weather rail and has to be changed over when tacking or gybing.,0
"From an aerodynamic point of view, with the wind on or forward of the beam the battens should be well arched in ghosting weather and should get progressively flatter as the wind speed increases.",0
"Unstayed masts cannot be used to carry conventional headsails or spinnakers except in the lightest of weather, as discussed in Chapter 5. Junk rigs carry one sail only on each mast. There is no sail changing, but only reefing and furling of this sail.",0
"A batten acts partly as a beam and partly as a strut, having to deal with bending loads and longitudinal compression.",0
Similar objections apply to various modern developments of roller headsails and roller mainsails on stayed masts.,0
"All the sails in this book are designed to lie on the port side of the mast for a practical reason: if anything should go wrong aloft it is then convenient to heave-to on the starboard tack, with right of way over other sailing vessels and with all the parrels and most of the other ropes on the windward side.",0
"The authors have always used unstayed masts on all types of hull, and these have proved fully seaworthy if correctly designed and built. Jester's original unstayed mast, of glued hollow spruce, survived 33 years of annual cruising and Atlantic crossings before it broke during a capsize in a storm at the end of her thirteenth crossing.",0
"With the sheet anchorage well abaft the leech of the sail, situation a shows that the sheets are trying to straighten the battens when closehauled. On a reach b,P and/ may coincide so that there is no forced. In c the sail is squared off for a run and the pull of the sheets is increasing the compression of the battens.",0
The bending (arching) of the battens plays a vital part in the boat's performance and also affects her steering.,0
S-bending may also be detectable at the luff of the sail if there is a large amount of balance forward of the mast.,0
Chinese vessels commonly carry large crews and have ample decks protected by bulwarks. There is no requirement for short-handed sailing and the crew is prepared to do a lot of 'fiddling' with the rig.,0
"Luckily, as soon as the sail is reefed the topping lifts go taut and the sail leans against the leeward lifts, which then help to prevent the battens from bending too far.",0
"Forced is trying to stretch and straighten the battens if it points away from the mast, or to compress and bend the battens if it points towards the mast.",0
"This makes it easier to see what is wrong, and if necessary to get aloft and attend to the trouble. In this book it will be assumed, for convenience in description, that all Chinese sails are set on the port side of the mast.",0
"It is possible to make ingenious suggestions for compound or fabricated battens which incorporate some positive means of controlling the arching to suit the aerodynamic requirements, but none of these has yet looked like meeting the practical need for a batten that is very strong, light, unbreakable, and cheap.",0
"There is also a vertical component acting downwards, but this is not relevant to the present discussion. The downward pull is transmitted through the leech to the yard, and thence to the halyard.",0
"This is the exact opposite of the natural behaviour of battens, and we have as yet no way of achieving it.",0
"The compression loads are more complex, and arise from a number of sources.",0
"For example, many Chinese sheet systems must be flipped round the leech when tacking or gybing.",0
"The battens must be strong and stiff enough to withstand such accumulative loading, and this inevitably means that the sail will set very flat in light airs. The sails in China seem to do the same, giving a rig that reaches its full efficiency in a hard breeze, the harder the better.",0
"Viewed from above (Fig. 1.6), the sheet parts exert a pullP which may be resolved into a force/ controlling the incidence of the sail by acting at 90° to its chord C, and a forced in line with the chord of the sail.",0
"In recent years there has been a movement, started in the United States, to develop other forms of easily-handled cruising rigs set on unstayed masts.",0
"In Fig. 1.7, the leech at A is exerting no compression, whereas that at B is. Any unsheeted battens, such as the top battens on many sails, take less bending load than a sheeted batten but throw additional loads on to their neighbours.",0
Battens are therefore designed to reach their maximum bend when running before the wind in a hard puff under full sail.,0
"So far the curvature of the sail has been discussed only in relation to the bending of the battens, i.e. curvature along the line of the batten.",0
"We are therefore stuck with battens that do the opposite of what we want, giving a flat sail in ghosting weather and a well-arched sail in a hard breeze. It is important that battens should not bend too much, particularly when close-hauled or reaching, since this gives less drive, more lateral force inducing heeling and leeway, and more weather helm. It has been found that fitting stiffer battens will reduce weather helm.",0
"Another source of batten compression is leech tension, but only if the leech changes direction at that batten.",0
"The final attitude d shows a situation that should never be allowed to develop; with the wind astern the sheets have been paid out until the leech of the sail is well forward of the mast, developing a very heavy compression B on the battens while the drive of the sail makes the boat heel to starboard.",0
"Even if the waves are running true to the wind, the wash of a passing ship may hit you straight on the nose.",0
"The junk rig offers this ease of handling, together with safety and sailing efficiency, with the help of some fresh development work that started in Britain in 1960 and is still continuing.",0
"This can be even more perplexing to a vane steering gear than it is to a human helmsman, but luckily no S-bending is normally detectable in rigs designed to the guidelines laid down in this book.",0
"On the port tack the batten presses against the mast and the batten parrel is slack. There is no external force capable of curving the] forward end of the batten to windward. Normally, with stiff battens and a moderate amount of balance, the forward end of the batten will appear to be straight, as at A, but with a soft batten and/or too much balance it can show an S-bend as at B.",0
These rigs demonstrate that cruising yachtsmen are willing to turn away from the labour-intensive rig of conventional ocean-racers and to accept the idea of unstayed masts.,0
"If true, this may be an effect of having the windage of the mast on the lee side.",0
"When close-reefed in a gale, however, unsheeted top battens may tend to bend the wrong way when off the wind. Fig. 1.8 shows such a batten supported in its middle by the topping-lifts but bent to leeward at its leech end. This may be described as 'S-bending'. A similar effect could be induced by double sheets (see p 72), if these sheets were attached to the battens at points well forward of the leech.",0
Tufts could be placed about 12 in (30 cm) apart right along the middle of each panel.,0
"On the starboard tack it hangs clear of the mast on a taut batten parrel P and the sheet S, and will take up a fair continuous curve.",0
"Gary Hoyt's original Freedom rig uses wrap-around jib-headed sails spread by wishbone booms, and there have been many later variations on this idea.",0
"If she luffs a little the batten snaps back to line A and the luff of the sail is relieved of wind pressure, whereupon the boat develops more weather helm and tries to luff further. If she is made to pay off again, the batten snaps back to line B and the luff of the sail catches more wind, whereupon she loses weather helm and tries to pay off further.",0
"Much could no doubt be learned by 'tufting' Chinese sails in order to study the airflow near the surfaces. Tufting consists in passing pieces of wool about 8 in (20 cm) long through the sail with a sail needle, middling them and tying an overhand knot each side of the cloth so as to retain them in position with about 3V2 in (9 cm) hanging free each side.",0
"The rigs themselves have not so far been able to compete with the main handling virtues of the junk rig, namely freedom from flogging, absence of concentrated stresses, and instantaneous reefing right down to bare poles.",0
"The Chinese construct a sail by laying out the yard, battens, and boom correctly positioned on a piece of flat ground and joining them all together with boltropes along the luff and leech.",0
"It is reduced by any vertical tension in the sailcloth, and therefore tends to be greatest in the lowest panel, which is supporting less weight. It will be least in the top panel, which is supporting the weight of all the panels below it.",0
"A possible exception is the situation mentioned earlier as being the rig's worst point, namely ghosting to windward in a lop.",0
"On the port tack the sail presses against the batten, and if the sail's scalloping is greater than the thickness of the batten it will press lightly against the mast in the middle part of each panel.",0
"The cloths are arranged more or less vertically, but may change direction at one or more battens to stay parallel with the leech.",0
"The sail also curves in a plane at right angles to the battens, i.e. by 'scalloping' between battens as shown diagrammatically in Fig. 1.10. Scalloping becomes more significant in a sail with relatively few battens and wide panels.",0
"Here it may be that the scalloped sail disturbs the smooth airflow when pitching, in which case reducing the scalloping could be beneficial.",0
"Scalloping may be reduced by pulling downwards on the sail, by means of a tackline when under full sail or by batten downhauls when reefed, as discussed in Chapter 3, but in fact it does not seem to do much harm to the boat's performance if allowed to develop naturally without any such restriction, as in China.",0
The profile shape is related to area because there is a maximum permissible capsizing moment for every hull,0
"The effect of this stretch is that the luff and leech scallop less than the middle of the sail, so that a plan view of one panel would show that the middle of the panel has greater fore-and-aft arching than that of the battens above and below it, as shown diagrammatically in Fig. 1.11.",0
"The purpose of the auxiliary battens is believed to be to reduce the chafing of the sail by the topping-lifts, even though the junk rig seems to suffer less from chafe than many Western rigs.",0
"A sail stretches somewhat with use, and the bunt of the sail stretches more than the luff or leech, particularly if these edges are taped or roped.",0
"Where such gaps exist it is common to take some of the battens through the gap and along the other side of the after part of the sail, as shown by dotted lines in Fig. 1.12.",0
"The reason for this is not known, unless it is to save sewing.",0
"On large sails one or more 'batten lifts' may be added, i.e. ropes joining yard, battens, and boom up the middle part of the sail.",0
"Any study of the sailing efficiency of the rig leads into the field of aerodynamics, but here it is best to tread with caution.",0
"In another Chinese variation, the after bonnet consists of separate vertical cloths, or groups of cloths, whose edges are not sewn together but are held together by stops at intervals of about a foot (0.3 m). Adjacent cloths then weave in and out of the battens in opposite directions, giving a basket-weave effect.",0
A sail that is broadest at the foot will obviously generate less capsizing moment than one which is broadest at the head.,0
"Large Chinese sails are often fitted with lighter auxiliary battens on the opposite side of the sail to the main battens, so that the sail is held between pairs of battens",0
"It seems probable that these laced gaps provide a convenient means of tensioning the sail along the battens without requiring the battens to protrude beyond the luff or leech, but one Western writer has suggested that they serve an aerodynamic purpose, producing some sort of slot effect. This seems unlikely, but the gap will undoubtedly permit the battens to take on more stagger when reefed, as discussed in Chapter 2.",0
"In the design of a single-masted rig, the first decisions to be taken are the sail's area and its profile shape. Since we cannot use additional working sails such as jibs or spinnakers without nullifying some of the main advantages of the rig, and since the sail is so easily reefed, it is best to give it a large area and accept early reefing. Some successful junk-rigged yachts take down their first panel somewhere between Force 3 and Force 4 when going to windward.",0
The batten of a large junk sail often consists of two shorter spars or bamboos fished together with a considerable overlap in the middle and with their butts outwards. Such a batten offers easy adjustment for length.,0
"More hot air has been talked about the aerodynamics of yacht sails than ever came out of a wind tunnel, and attempts to apply undiluted aircraft theory to sailing boats have often done more harm than good.",0
The natural color of these boats would have appeared a light reddish blond color depending on the age and dryness of both woods before construction.,0
Anyone who insists on trying to relate the behaviour of a junk sail to aerodynamic theory might well start by looking at the theory of thin-plate aerofoils of different curvatures; but there may be more profitable ways of spending his time. In the following discussion the reader must distinguish between what is conjecture and what is fact.,0
The forward part of the sail always has all its battens between sail and mast.,0
"The edges of the cloths are usually sewn together to make a single sail, but there are variations on this. Some large square-headed sails have a vertical gap right down the sail, dividing it into two vertical bonnets whose edges are then laced together across the gap as in Fig. 1.12 (after Worcester), which shows an 18-batten sail.",0
"Nearly all progress in rig design has been made by practical skippers and yacht designers who have declined to believe any theory until it has been confirmed by comparative testing, preferably on full-sized boats racing against other similar boats. We need much more of this process to continue to improve the junk rig.",0
"Once this part of the project has been completed, set the pieces aside for assembly later.",0
"In aircraft, 'slot effect' is a means of preventing the breakdown of airflow over a wing when it would otherwise stall due to low speed and high incidence, conditions that normally arise only during landing and take-off",0
"The single-masted rig seems to be at least as efficient to windward as the multi-masted rigs, and sometimes more efficient downwind in light or moderate going, but there has been no opportunity for direct comparison on identical hulls.",0
The position of the reefed sail is drawn by superimposing the required number of panels on top of the furled position of the lowest operational batten.,0
The medium-size Nile River boats like Queen Hatshepsut’s were usually built of sycamore and cedar from the land that is now Lebanon.,0
"In Bermudian sloops it is held that slot effect is developed between headsail and mainsail, and that this is responsible for increases in windward efficiency.",0
"Aerodynamicists often advocate the use of a very tall, narrow sail for efficiency to windward, and although there is evidence to support this the practical disadvantages may be decisive. The choice of shape will often be influenced by considerations of mast position and helm effects, as discussed in Chapter 6.",0
The positions of the furled battens in Fig. 2.4 and 2.6 show the extreme limits that can be obtained in that sail using modern synthetic sailcloth which will not distort diagonally.,0
"If beneficial slot effect can be induced in multi-masted Chinese rigs it should be possible to demonstrate, by tufting, that the turbulence in the airflow is reduced by it. It is possible that a small junk foresail can be made to improve the efficiency of a junk mainsail, and that the sail plans shown in Fig. 1.3 c, e and h benefit from this effect, but we have as yet no evidence of it.",0
"Most Western seamen feel instinctively that a 'fanned' sail, with the yard at a steep angle, should be more efficient than a square-headed sail (compare Figs. 16.2 and 16.4), but this is not yet established very firmly. The square head is used in China on a number of junks of apparently advanced design, both seagoing and inland, and is perhaps best suited to tall, narrow sails.",0
"With centre }^ and radius }H, mark H! which is the after end of batten 2 when furled.",0
"It is best to use a thick sheet of balsa wood, because balsa can be easily curved when wet and it can hold that curve once it is dry. The canopy pattern on page 39 shows that it has a wavelike appearance.",0
A scale drawing of the model’s display stand and a copy of a 1467 B.C. pottery shard from Queen Hatsheput’s time period can be found on page 42.,0
The two steering oars are to be mounted onto the boat’s stern with steering oar supports. (See page 45 for this pattern.) You will need to drill one hole in each support where indicated.,0
Whether or not this is the whole truth is beyond the scope of this book.,0
"There is also a period floor design for the throne platform on page 41 (this is optional). Once all of these parts have been made, set them aside for assembly later.",0
"In our present state of knowledge the choice of rig should be based on considerations of size, mast position, and steering effects, rather than on half-digested aerodynamics.",0
This special piece will be mounted on the stand later. The base’s mounting post that supports the completed model is made from a 0.016″ round brass rod that is 2″ long.,0
Make sure the loop is wide enough to hold each oar in place. The blades are made from thick balsa wood and each oar shaft is made of 0.005″ round brass rods that are 1½″ long.,0
"With centre G! and radius GF mark FI, which is the after end of batten 1 when furled",0
"The foregoing analysis of the sail drawn in Fig. 2.4 has shown that there was more to it than met the eye when this random shape was first sketched. The sail shape is not very suitable for Western needs, and it is now appropriate to make a fresh start by considering some very basic sail shapes.",0
The blades are made from thick balsa wood and each oar shaft is made of 0.008″ round brass rods that are 1″ long.,0
"Fig. 2.9 shows a rectangular sail in three attitudes: full sail, close reefed to two panels, and furled.",0
"To be preoccupied by theory is often a sign of inexperience, and a reason for not gaining more experience.",0
"With centre F! and radius FJ, strike an arc down to a level just above Gt and mark Ji, which is the furthest forward position of the forward end of batten 2 when furled.",0
"To duplicate these curves after cutting out the canopy piece on page 45, hold the wood under warm water for a few minutes then gently bend and form the wood into a slight wavelike appearance.",0
"The battens are all of the same length, an obvious practical advantage if spare battens have to be carried. In this and all subsequent examples the battens will be shown furled according to the principle already stated, i.e. each pushed forward as far as the diagonal tension in the panel below it will permit. In this case the mast line (broken line) would present no problems, but all the battens have negative stagger at the leech and are therefore unsuited to single sheets. The amount of negative stagger would be reduced if the sail had more, and hence narrower, panels, but the same objection would apply.",0
The six rowing oars are attached to the main deck with eyelets. To make the eyelets carefully bend a 0.006″ round brass rod into a small loop using needle-nose pliers.,0
"Here you will see the shape of the ¼″ high wood stand, as well as the shape and appearance of the ancient pottery shard image.",0
Make the four canopy support posts from 0.012″ round brass rods. Each post will be 1¼″ long.,0
"If the same panel is now filled with a polyester sailcloth that is inelastic and cannot be distorted diagonally, the limits become much narrower since they are now imposed by the unstretchable diagonals CA and DB (Fig. 2.2), giving new limiting positions A^! and A2B2, with possible furled positions anywhere between these two.",0
"The pharaoh’s throne platform can be made from balsa, walnut, or basswood.",0
"The strips are to be glued to each side of the platform, or you can make and color your own hieroglyphic markings.",0
The ways in which a Chinese sail may be reefed and furled are severely restricted by the battens and by the diagonal tensions in the sailcloth. Fig. 2.1 shows a rectangular sail panel with battens AB and CD.,0
The mast is 4½″ long. See the drawing on page 41 for the general outline of the mast. Refer to the model drawing to locate the placement of the mast on page 40.,0
When drawing a complete sail it is necessary to analyse its reefing and furling characteristics by taking each panel in turn and superimposing it on the furled attitude of the panel below it.,0
"Use a piece of extra-fine sandpaper to remove any rough edges after cutting. Once this has been done, go to page 41 and cut out the hieroglyphic symbol strips.",0
"When a panel is furled the folded sailcloth would, if not supported by topping lifts, be free to hang below the lower batten in a shape that would depend partly on the attitude of the upper batten. If the latter were midway between its limits the cloth would often hang in a single uncreased fold, but if near its limit the fold would become complex and heavily creased along the controlling diagonal. Obviously, the wider the panel the greater the amount of loose cloth that would hang down when furled and the greater the need for a multiple topping-lift system to gather and hold it.",0
The sail’s top and bottom yards are made from wood dowel. Follow the scale drawing on page 41 to make these pieces.,0
"With centre D and radius DG, strike an arc down to a level just above the boom and mark d, which is the furthest forward position of the forward end of batten 1 when furled.",0
"If, as is usual, the shape of the sail panel is some form of quadrilateral other than a rectangle, the diagonals will still control the limits of the furled positions as shown in Fig. 2.3a, b, and c, while the near-triangular panel (d) has in effect only one furled attitude.",0
"If there were no sailcloth and they were simply joined together by boltropes AD and BC, the top batten could furl to A^! if it were forced fully to the right, or to A2B2 if forced fully to the left, or to any intermediate position between these two.",0
The measurements are: ″ x x ″. The steps are three small strips built up to resemble stairs.,0
Page 40 shows exactly where to glue the completed throne platform to the main deck.,0
"The limits are defined by the radii DA and CB. For clarity, the two positions of the furled batten are shown one above the other, whereas in practice they would both come right down to the lower batten.",0
"Refer to the scale drawing of the mast on page 41. This mast is a single pole, a style made popular during Queen Hatshepsut’s time.",0
